## Current Status

**Current session**: 67 — Partner contact-type table Phase 1 + Phase 2 (2026-05-04) — **PIVOT + UI WIRING IN ONE SESSION.** Started by adding separate Agent + Wholesaler tables (commit `bb94f97` deployed to Railway). Within the hour Corey said "I think we just need one big database of contacts and then have a contact type which can be a whole array of options" — so dropped the 4 empty tables and replaced with one unified `Partner` table + `PropertyPartner` join. `Partner.types` is a JSON array (`agent` | `wholesaler` | `attorney` | `title` | `lender` | `inspector` | `contractor` | `photographer` | `property_manager` | `other`) — one person can carry multiple types. `PropertyPartner.role` is a free string for the per-deal role. Seller + Buyer **stay as their own typed tables** (200+ specialized fields each — vendor enrichment, TCP scoring, disposition flow all keyed there; merging them would invalidate v1.1 Wave 4-5 work). Two migrations on disk back-to-back: `20260504000000_add_agent_wholesaler` (the now-superseded 4-table shape) + `20260504010000_replace_agent_wholesaler_with_partner` (drops the 4 empty tables CASCADE + creates `partners` + `property_partners`). Zero data loss — no UI / API ever wrote to the intermediate tables. `npx prisma format` clean, `npx prisma generate` clean, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0. **Input source is GHL contacts (scattered, not in dedicated pipelines)** — Phase 2 link UX is "find a GHL contact → assign one or more partner types → Gunner creates the row pointing at that ghlContactId". Phase 1 ships zero behavioral change (empty tables). Phases 2-4 follow: property-detail link UX, list/detail pages, contacts-page tab. **Previous: Session 66 — Day Hub consolidation + vendor flag-gating (2026-05-03)** — `/tasks` page consolidated to `/day-hub` with redirect stub for Chris's bookmark; `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED` allowlist gates BatchData / CourtListener / RentCast / RealEstateAPI off by default (PR + Google enabled). — **TWO SIMPLIFICATIONS SHIPPED.** (1) `/{tenant}/tasks` and `/{tenant}/day-hub` were dual surfaces; nav pointed at `/tasks` (the richer page) while docs claimed `/day-hub` was canonical. Consolidated by moving the 3 files (`page.tsx`, `day-hub-client.tsx`, `KpiLedgerModal.tsx`) from `/tasks/` to `/day-hub/` (overwriting the simpler /day-hub variant) and replacing `/tasks/page.tsx` with a tiny `redirect()` stub for Chris's bookmark. Updated 7 internal links across top-nav, dashboard, settings, and 4 admin-only redirect targets to point at `/day-hub` directly. (2) Property-data vendor sprawl gated behind `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED` env allowlist. New `lib/enrichment/vendor-flags.ts` is the single source of truth. Default = `propertyradar,google` (PR primary + Google for Inventory Street View images). The 4 other vendors (BatchData, CourtListener, RentCast, RealEstateAPI) are gated off by default. Setting `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED=propertyradar,google,batchdata,courtlistener` restores pre-Session-66 behavior; `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED=propertyradar` drops Google too (no images on new properties — existing photos remain in DB). Code paths preserved for instant reversibility — schema columns untouched. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. **Previous: Session 65 — Blocker #2 verification infra (2026-05-02) — HIGH-STAKES AUDIT ENDPOINT SHIPPED + DEPLOY-FAILURE INCIDENT CLOSED.** Plan was to build the verification surface for Blocker #2 (Role Assistant production verification of 6 high-stakes action types) — diagnostic endpoint, ritual doc. While verifying the deploy live, discovered Railway had been silently FAILING all deploys since 2026-05-01 18:56 (the Phase 4 success): Phase 5, Session-64 close, AND today's high-stakes-audit endpoint never made it to production. Root cause: `config/env.ts` strict validation killed `next build` because Railway's build env lacks `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (and the var was never in runtime env either — schema/use-site mismatch since the use site at `app/api/webhooks/ghl/route.ts:15-19` already treats it as optional). Two fixes: (1) skip `process.exit(1)` during `NEXT_PHASE='phase-production-build'`, (2) make `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` schema optional. Commits: `0c6eb89` (high-stakes-audit endpoint + AUDIT_PLAN.md ritual + OPERATIONS.md cross-link), `3433c21` (env build-phase fix), `7ac5ee7` (env schema fix). Final deploy SUCCESS at 2026-05-02 15:58 UTC; high-stakes-audit endpoint verified live with proper JSON shape. The 4 commits that had been stuck on yesterday's build (Phase 5, session-close, high-stakes-audit, env-build-fix) are now all in production. **Previous: Session 64 — Pre-Scaling Cleanup Wave (2026-05-01) — CLEANUP WAVE COMPLETE.** All 6 waves shipped + applied + verified across Sessions 60-63 (4 calendar days, 2026-04-30 → 2026-05-01). Reliability scorecard dim #8 (Seller/Buyer data model) **moved 4 → 8/10 (target met)**. Sellers + Buyers are now first-class entities with structured names, person flags, portfolio aggregates, motivation + likelihood scores. 117 sellers have populated TCP-equivalent scores; 3,244 calls auto-linked retroactively + runtime hook fires on new graded calls. PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore is the per-property fit (replaces wrong-unit Buyer.matchLikelihoodScore). Schema dual-representation closed by Wave 5 strip (24 columns + 2 indexes dropped).
**Phase**: ✅ **v1-finish sprint COMPLETE** (2026-04-30, all 7 waves closed). Wave 1 closed Blocker #3 + AUDIT_PLAN P3 (commit `047ca18`). Wave 2 closed P1 + P2 + dashboard drift (commits `98e5e7d` / `525e8b8` / `6fe3010`). **Wave 3 fully closed** (Sessions 47-53, commit `00cb686`): 72 routes migrated, 91/91 tenant-scoped routes on `withTenant`, 38 latent defense gaps fixed, 4 leak classes catalogued in AGENTS.md, 6 Class 4 helpers hardened. **Wave 4 closed** (Session 54, commits `2c256f5` + `3651080`): 17 prod identifiers scrubbed across 9 files, D-044 codified. **Wave 5 partial close** (Session 55, commit `9d6f7ae`): Bug #12 verified-current and closed; P4 (legacy /tasks/ deletion) **DEFERRED — v1.1** with 5-step migration plan documented in AUDIT_PLAN.md. **Wave 6 fully closed** (Sessions 56-58, commits `375354b` + `5e09a20` + `99464bb`): View As hydration race fix shipped + verified live by Corey 2026-04-30 (V1 + V4 PASS). Shape C queued as P6 — v1.1 sprint candidate. **Wave 7 (this session)**: final verification — all 9 v1-launch-ready exit criteria met or explicitly deferred. Reliability scorecard: all 8 dimensions ≥7/10 except item 8 (Seller/Buyer data model = 4/10, the v1.1 redesign target). webhook_logs last 24h: 1558 received, 1 failed (0.06%), 0 stuck. Multi-vendor enrichment live, in-process grading worker live, bug-report system live. **Next: v1.1 sprint — Seller/Buyer integration plan (PLAN FIRST, no code until approved).**
**App state**: Live on Railway
**GitHub**: https://github.com/c7lavinder/Gunner-Claude
**Railway**: [PRODUCTION_URL]
**GHL OAuth**: CONNECTED — tenant "New Again Houses" (location: [GHL_LOCATION_ID])
**Grading worker**: in-process via `instrumentation.ts` → `lib/grading-worker.ts` → `lib/grading-processor.ts` (60s tick). Sole driver as of Wave 1 — legacy `[[services]] grading-worker` removed (Blocker #3 closed). Manual debug surface remains at `app/api/cron/process-recording-jobs/route.ts`.
**Pipeline verifier**: `scripts/verify-calls-pipeline.ts` — bidirectional A/B with sanity gate + canary
**Active blockers**: #2 (Action execution discipline — production verification pending). #3 closed Wave 1.
**Orientation docs**: `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` (slow-changing) + `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (fast-changing) replaced ARCHITECTURE / MODULES / TECH_STACK / AI-ARCHITECTURE-PLAN / GUNNER_DAYHUB_CALLS_PROMPT / START_HERE — those now in `docs/archive/`. CLAUDE.md Rule 8 (Living Map Discipline) requires updating SYSTEM_MAP or OPERATIONS in the same commit as any module / page / cron / AI tool / API surface / readable schema field change.

## Session Log (recent — older sessions in docs/SESSION_ARCHIVE.md)

### Session 67 — Partner contact-type table, Phase 1 (2026-05-04)

Corey opened with an architectural question: "at the very base of this
site I need the properties, then I need the database of contact types
that are assigned to the properties. Outside of buyers and sellers,
there would be real estate agents (who bring us deals or send our deals
to their clients) and other wholesalers (who try to sell us houses or
sell our houses to their buyer list)."

**Mid-session architectural pivot.** This session shipped TWO
migrations back-to-back. The first created separate Agent + Wholesaler
tables (the answer Corey picked in plan mode). After it deployed, he
came back with: "I think we just need one big database of contacts and
then have a contact type which can be a whole array of options." Walked
through two interpretations of "one big database" — the moderate one
(unify Agent+Wholesaler into Partner; keep Seller+Buyer separate) vs
the aggressive one (unify EVERYTHING including Seller+Buyer). He picked
the moderate path, so the second migration drops the 4 empty
Agent/Wholesaler tables and creates a unified Partner + PropertyPartner.

Real wholesale deals routinely involve four contact types — Seller,
Buyer, Agent, Wholesaler — but Gunner today only models the first two.
There was no way to track which agent sourced a deal or which
wholesaler we'd JV'd with. The plan went through Plan-mode design with
Corey choosing two key directions:

1. **Schema shape:** separate Agent + Wholesaler tables mirroring the
   Seller/Buyer first-class pattern (rejected: generic "Partner" table,
   reusing the dormant `PropertySeller.role` field).
2. **Input source:** GHL contacts. Agents and wholesalers are
   scattered across normal GHL contacts (no dedicated pipelines), so
   no bulk-sync-from-pipeline route is built. The link UX (Phase 2)
   will be: find a GHL contact → mark as Agent/Wholesaler → Gunner
   creates the row pointing at that `ghlContactId`.

The plan is phased into four ships:
- **Phase 1 (this session):** schema only. 2 new tables (Partner +
  PropertyPartner), no UI.
- **Phase 2:** property-detail page integration ("Link Partner"
  button + GHL contact picker modal + per-deal role/economics).
- **Phase 3:** standalone list + detail pages (`/{tenant}/partners`
  with type filter).
- **Phase 4:** contacts-page tabs (extend the existing tabbed
  Sellers/Buyers UI with a third Partners tab).

**Plan reference:** `~/.claude/plans/at-te-he-very-base-mellow-pixel.md`

**Final Phase 1 changes (post-pivot):**

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` — first added 4 models (Agent, Wholesaler,
   PropertyAgent, PropertyWholesaler) following the Seller/Buyer
   pattern. After Corey's pivot, replaced with 2 unified models:
   - **`Partner`** (~50 fields) — `types: Json` array carries roles
     (`agent` | `wholesaler` | `attorney` | `title` | `lender` |
     `inspector` | `contractor` | `photographer` |
     `property_manager` | `other`). Identity + GHL link via
     `ghlContactId`. Agent-flavored fields nullable
     (`brokerageName`, `licenseNumber`, `licenseState`,
     `licenseExpiration`). Wholesaler-flavored fields nullable
     (`buyerListSize`, `dealsPerMonthEstimate`, `prefersAssignment`,
     `typicalAssignmentFee`). Cross-portfolio performance counters
     (`dealsSourcedToUsCount`, `dealsTakenFromUsCount`,
     `dealsClosedWithUsCount`, `jvHistoryCount`), reputation
     (`partnerGrade` A/B/C/D, `tierClassification`), market focus,
     communication prefs, standard `tags` / `internalNotes` /
     `customFields` / `fieldSources` / `priorityFlag`.
     `@@index([tenantId, phone])` + `@@index([tenantId, ghlContactId])`.
   - **`PropertyPartner`** — composite PK (propertyId, partnerId).
     Free-string `role` for per-deal capture (extensible without
     schema change). Per-deal economics: `commissionPercent`,
     `commissionAmount`, `purchasePrice`, `assignmentFeePaid` (all
     nullable, only relevant fields filled). `notesOnThisDeal`,
     timestamps.
   - Back-relations: `partners Partner[]` on `Tenant`,
     `partners PropertyPartner[]` on `Property`.
2. **Two migrations on disk:**
   - `20260504000000_add_agent_wholesaler` — original 4-table shape.
     Already deployed to production via commit `bb94f97`. Empty in prod.
   - `20260504010000_replace_agent_wholesaler_with_partner` — drops
     the 4 empty tables (CASCADE) + creates `partners` +
     `property_partners`. 2 CREATE TABLE + 2 indexes + 3 foreign keys.
3. `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` — replaced "Agents + Wholesalers" subsection
   with a "Partners" subsection. Updated GHL boundary table to call
   out `Partner.types[]` covering the deal-team roles.
4. `docs/OPERATIONS.md` — both migrations logged; the first marked
   superseded.

**Why two migrations instead of consolidating into one:** Commit
`bb94f97` already deployed to production (the 4 empty tables exist on
the prod DB). To remove them, a forward migration is needed — Prisma
won't let us "uncommit" a migration that's already in
`_prisma_migrations`. The clean path is a follow-up migration that
drops + creates the new shape. Both stay in version history forever
as a record of the pivot.

**Important non-goals (explicitly NOT in Phase 1):** UI surfaces, GHL
sync logic, list/detail pages, contacts-page tabs, TCP-style scoring
on partners, deal-blast support for partners, AI auto-generation of
partner summaries. The only thing Phase 1 ships is data structure.

**Verification:** `npx prisma format` clean. `npx prisma generate`
clean (Prisma Client v5.22.0 regenerated twice — once after each
schema change). `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0.

**Files modified by this session (Session 67):**
- New: `prisma/migrations/20260504000000_add_agent_wholesaler/migration.sql`
  (committed in `bb94f97`)
- New: `prisma/migrations/20260504010000_replace_agent_wholesaler_with_partner/migration.sql`
- Edited: `prisma/schema.prisma` (Partner + PropertyPartner replace
  the prior 4 models; back-relations on Tenant + Property updated to
  point at Partner / PropertyPartner), `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md`,
  `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `PROGRESS.md` (this entry)

**Phase 2 shipped same session ("hammer it out"):**

After Phase 1 deployed, Corey said "hammer it out" — built the full
property-detail UX in the same session.

1. **`lib/partners/sync.ts` (108 lines)** — `upsertPartnerFromGHL()`
   helper. Idempotent on (tenantId, ghlContactId): existing rows get
   their `types` array merged with new types and contact details
   refreshed (never wiped to null); new rows seeded with the GHL
   payload. Exports `PARTNER_TYPES` const tuple + `isPartnerType()`
   guard for use in API zod schemas.
2. **`app/api/properties/[propertyId]/partners/route.ts` (216 lines)**
   — GET/POST/DELETE. POST handles two actions:
   - Default branch: link a new partner. Calls `upsertPartnerFromGHL`,
     creates `PropertyPartner` join row with role + economics. Returns
     the linked partner shape.
   - `action: 'update'` branch: update an existing PropertyPartner
     row's per-deal fields (role, commission, purchase price,
     assignment fee, notes).
   - DELETE removes the join row only — Partner stays for future
     deals. Permission gated on `properties.edit`. Mirrors the
     sibling sellers route shape exactly.
3. **`components/inventory/partners-tab.tsx` (462 lines)** — three
   client components:
   - `<PartnersTab>` — top-level container with header + "Link
     Partner" toggle + cards list.
   - `<LinkPartnerForm>` — GHL contact search via `/api/ghl/contacts`,
     multi-type chips (10 types selectable), per-deal role dropdown
     (15 options), conditional economics fields (commission shows for
     agent flavors, purchase/assignment shows for wholesaler
     flavors), notes textarea, validation requires at least one type.
   - `<PartnerCard>` — read view with name + type badges + grade pill
     + per-deal facts row, edit toggle that switches to inline form
     (role + 4 economics fields + notes), unlink button with confirm.
4. **`components/inventory/property-detail-client.tsx` edits:** added
   `Partners` tab to TABS, `partners` to PropertyDetail interface,
   `<PartnersTab>` mount in tab-render block, Briefcase icon import,
   PartnersTab import.
5. **`app/(tenant)/[tenant]/inventory/[propertyId]/page.tsx` edits:**
   added `partners: { include: { partner: { select: ... } } }` to
   the Prisma fetch, added partners-mapping step in the prop
   serialization (Decimal → string).
6. **`docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md`** — extended Partners section with the
   Phase 2 file roster.
7. **`docs/OPERATIONS.md`** — bumped route count 110 → 113, withTenant
   count 91 → 92.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0 after every step. Pre-push
hook will re-run before push.

**End of Session 67 reliability scorecard delta:**

| # | Dimension | S66 | S67 | Δ | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Call ingestion | 9 | 9 | — | No regression. |
| 2 | Grading pipeline | 9 | 9 | — | No regression. |
| 3 | Multi-tenancy | 9 | 9 | — | New partners route uses `withTenant` + property-tenant validation gate. |
| 4 | Error visibility | 8 | 8 | — | No change. |
| 5 | Documentation hygiene | 9 | 9 | — | SYSTEM_MAP + OPERATIONS + PROGRESS all updated in same commit per Rule 8. |
| 6 | Repo security posture | 8 | 8 | — | No identifier leaks. |
| 7 | Production verification discipline | 9 | 9 | — | Phase 1 + 2 verified via tsc; live verification deferred to Corey clicking Link Partner on a real property. |
| 8 | Seller/Buyer contact data model | 8 | 8 | — | Untouched by this session. |

Average **8.625/10** (unchanged). Net new dimension we should consider
adding: "Partner / deal-team data model" — would start at 7/10
(schema + API + UI all live, but no list page yet, no GHL bulk sync,
no scoring).

**Next session:** Phase 3 candidates — standalone `/{tenant}/partners`
list page with type filter, Partners tab on the existing `/contacts`
page (Phase 4), or fresh work entirely. Phase 2 ships value end-to-end
on the property detail page; the rest is gravy.

**Side-finding (deferred to backlog):** `PropertySeller.role` field at
`prisma/schema.prisma:1046` defaults to `"Seller"` but is **never read
or written** by any code. Either wire it or drop it — leaving an
unused-but-typed field is the worst of both worlds. Not blocking;
flagging for a future cleanup pass.

### Session 66 — Day Hub consolidation + vendor flag-gating (2026-05-03)

Two independent simplifications shipped after a "where are we, is it
over-complicated, what should we cut" audit conversation with Corey.

**Audit findings that drove this session:**

- The nav showed "Day Hub" pointing at `/{tenant}/tasks`
  ([components/ui/top-nav.tsx:66](components/ui/top-nav.tsx#L66)). Docs
  claimed `/{tenant}/day-hub` was canonical. They were two different
  pages — `/tasks/page.tsx` (358 lines) had richer logic (GHL live fetch,
  classification, AM/PM dial pills, KpiLedgerModal). `/day-hub/page.tsx`
  (201 lines) was the simpler DB-only variant. The "consolidation"
  documented in CLAUDE.md Rule 3 § 7 had never actually happened.
- Property-data enrichment ran 6 vendors (PropertyRadar, BatchData,
  CourtListener, RentCast, RealEstateAPI, Google). RentCast +
  RealEstateAPI were dead code (only callers in
  `scripts/vendor-comparison.ts`). The other 4 had real call sites in
  `lib/enrichment/`. PR is the primary; the rest fill gaps. Corey asked
  whether going pure-PR would simplify operations.

**Phase 1 — Day Hub consolidation:**

1. `mv app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/{page,day-hub-client,KpiLedgerModal}.tsx
   → app/(tenant)/[tenant]/day-hub/` — overwrites the simpler `/day-hub`
   variant. Atomic, no ambiguity about which was the source of truth.
2. New `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/page.tsx` is a 4-line stub:
   `redirect(/${params.tenant}/day-hub)`. Preserves Chris's bookmark and
   any external `/tasks` links without keeping a parallel page alive.
3. Updated 7 internal references from `/tasks` → `/day-hub`:
   - `components/ui/top-nav.tsx` (×2 — nav link + logo `<Link>`)
   - `components/ui/dashboard-client.tsx:276` ("All →" link from
     dashboard tasks card)
   - `components/settings/settings-client.tsx:487` (View-As redirect
     after picking a teammate)
   - `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/{bugs,ai-logs,health,kpis}/page.tsx`
     (4 admin-only role-gate redirects for non-admins)
4. Updated header comments in moved files to reflect the new path.

**Phase 2 — Property-vendor flag-gating:**

1. New `lib/enrichment/vendor-flags.ts` — single source of truth for
   `isVendorEnabled(name)` reading the `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED`
   env allowlist. Default = `propertyradar,google`.
2. `config/env.ts` — added optional `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED` schema
   entry with documentation block above it.
3. `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts` — gated the 4 vendor calls (PR,
   Google, BatchData, CourtListener) behind `isVendorEnabled(...)` AND
   the existing `opts.skip*` testing flags. Either gate disables the
   call. Result-shape unchanged; disabled vendors emit
   `result.batchdata.skipped = 'env_disabled'` so the orchestrator log
   line still tells the truth.
4. `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts:skipTraceSeller` — gated by
   `isVendorEnabled('batchdata')`. Returns
   `{ fieldsTouched: [], traced: false }` when disabled (the existing
   no-op shape, which `app/api/sellers/[sellerId]/skip-trace/route.ts`
   already returns as `200 { traced: false }`).

**What's reversible vs irreversible:**

- All 5 vendor modules + their schema columns are untouched. Setting
  `ENRICHMENT_VENDORS_ENABLED=propertyradar,google,batchdata,courtlistener`
  on Railway restores pre-session behavior with zero code change.
- The `/tasks` page now permanently redirects to `/day-hub`. Chris's
  bookmark still works.

**Files modified by this session (Session 66, single push):**

- Renamed: 3 files moved `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/*` →
  `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/day-hub/*` (overwrites prior `/day-hub` files)
- New: `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/page.tsx` (redirect stub),
  `lib/enrichment/vendor-flags.ts`
- Edited: `config/env.ts`, `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts`,
  `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts`, `components/ui/top-nav.tsx`,
  `components/ui/dashboard-client.tsx`, `components/settings/settings-client.tsx`,
  `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/bugs/page.tsx`,
  `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/ai-logs/page.tsx`,
  `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/health/page.tsx`,
  `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/kpis/page.tsx`,
  `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `PROGRESS.md` (this entry)

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0.

**Next session:** Run the Blocker #2 verification ritual (still pending
from Session 65). Corey drives the live UI through the 6 high-stakes
Role Assistant tools per `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md`; Claude reads
`/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit` to confirm each tool's count
increments. Then either (a) decide on the 3 still-built-but-hidden
pages — Disposition Hub (Buyers), Lead Source ROI, Training Hub —
ship them or delete them, or (b) start the property-photo backfill
question if Corey wants to drop Google too.

### Session 65 — Blocker #2 verification infra + Railway deploy-failure incident (2026-05-02)

Plan was clean: build the verification surface for Blocker #2 (Role
Assistant production verification of 6 high-stakes action types). The
audit revealed all 3 code-side fixes from the original 4-step blocker
plan are already shipped (webhook silent catch closed, requireApproval
on deal-blast wired, editedInput contract complete in coach-sidebar +
execute route). What was missing: a single surface to verify the
evidence trail in one read. So this session shipped:

1. **`/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit`** (commit `0c6eb89`) — token-gated
   diagnostic at `app/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit/route.ts`. Returns
   per-tool counts (24h / 7d / 30d / failures24h) + last 5 success +
   last 5 failure rows for each of 6 high-stakes Role Assistant tools
   (`send_sms_blast`, `send_email_blast`, `bulk_tag_contacts`,
   `remove_contact_from_property`, `remove_team_member`,
   `change_property_status`). Plus per-gate counts (`gate.<action>.pending` +
   `gate.approved`) for the underlying `requireApproval` flow at
   `lib/gates/requireApproval.ts`. Plus universal totals + failure-rate.
   Source refs in the response `notes` field.

2. **AUDIT_PLAN.md Blocker #2 rewrite** (same commit) — status changed
   from "IN PROGRESS" to "CODE SHIPPED, VERIFICATION OWED" with cross-
   references to the now-shipped fixes (file:line citations so the
   verifier can sanity-check before running the ritual). New "Blocker #2
   verification ritual" section with exact UI click-paths for all 6 tools,
   expected `audit_log` evidence per tool, and acceptance criteria for
   closing the blocker. Includes cancel-path checks (the Reject button
   should leave no `assistant.action.<tool>` row — half the value).

3. **OPERATIONS.md "Diagnostic endpoints" table extended** (same commit)
   with the new endpoint per Living Map discipline (Rule 8).

**Then the incident.** Pre-flight live verification of the new endpoint
returned HTTP 404. Root-cause investigation surfaced that **Railway had
been silently FAILING all deploys since 2026-05-01 18:56** (last
successful deploy was Phase 4 of Session 64). 6 deploys had failed:
Phase 5 (REGISTRY.md), Session-64 close, and today's high-stakes-audit
endpoint were ALL stuck on yesterday's build.

`railway deployment list --service Gunner-Claude` showed the truth:

| Time | SHA | State |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-01 18:56 | `1f5d42b` (Phase 4) | ✅ SUCCESS |
| 2026-05-01 19:01-19:11 | various | ❌ FAILED ×5 |
| 2026-05-02 15:34 | `0c6eb89` (high-stakes-audit) | ❌ FAILED |

Build logs revealed the failure mode:
```
❌ Missing or invalid environment variables:
{ GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET: [ 'Required' ] }
 ⨯ Next.js build worker exited with code: 1
```

`config/env.ts` strict validation was killing `next build` page-data
collection because Railway's build env doesn't have `GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
And per `railway variables --service Gunner-Claude --kv | cut -d= -f1`,
the var is **not in runtime env either** — it has never been set.

But the worker has been running for weeks. How? **The previous container
from the 18:56 deploy was still running on yesterday's image; subsequent
restarts (had any happened) would have crashed at startup with
`process.exit(1)` because `NODE_ENV=production` + missing required env.**
A restart would have caused full production outage. We were sitting on
a landmine.

`GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is read in exactly one place
(`app/api/webhooks/ghl/route.ts:15-19`), and the comment at that site
literally says "optional — only when GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set". Schema
was just out of sync with the use site — the same class of fix as
making `RESEND_API_KEY` optional in Phase 2.

**Two fixes shipped:**

- **`3433c21` (`fix(env): allow build phase to skip process.exit`)** —
  `config/env.ts` now skips `process.exit(1)` during
  `NEXT_PHASE='phase-production-build'`. Strict validation still applies
  at dev startup + production runtime. Build no longer dies on
  build-time-only env shape issues.
- **`7ac5ee7` (`fix(env): GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET schema → optional`)** —
  matches the use-site comment. Use site's fail-open behavior
  (skip-signature-verification log) is preserved. Re-tightening is one
  line away if Corey ever sets the var on Railway.

Final deploy `c1bfb74...` SUCCESS at 2026-05-02 15:58:29 UTC. Container
came up clean. Smoke test of high-stakes-audit endpoint via
`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN" "https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit?tenant=new-again-houses"`
returned HTTP 200 with the right JSON shape (6 tools listed, 4 gates
listed, all counts at 0 — expected since no high-stakes activity has
been triggered in the last 30d, which is exactly the gap Blocker #2
verification needs to fill).

**Side-finding (deferred):** `/api/health` returns the same timestamp
on every call (Next.js statically renders it because the route handler
takes no `request` parameter). Not blocking — just means health checks
don't actually probe DB connectivity per request. Would need
`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to fix. Adding to bigger
backlog as a one-liner cleanup candidate.

**Next session can now actually run the verification ritual.** Corey
drives the live UI through the 6 tools per the `AUDIT_PLAN.md` "Blocker
#2 verification ritual" click-paths; Claude reads
`/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit` periodically and confirms each
tool's count increments. Acceptance criteria already documented in the
ritual section.

**Files modified by this session (4 commits):**
- `app/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit/route.ts` (new)
- `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` (Blocker #2 section rewrite + ritual)
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (diagnostic endpoint cross-link)
- `config/env.ts` (build-phase guard + GHL_WEBHOOK_SECRET optional)
- `PROGRESS.md` (this entry)

**Reliability scorecard delta (post-incident, vs Session 64):**

| # | Dimension | S64 | S65 | Δ | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Call ingestion | 9 | 9 | — | No regression. |
| 2 | Grading pipeline | 9 | 9 | — | No regression. |
| 3 | Multi-tenancy | 9 | 9 | — | New diagnostic endpoint takes `?tenant=<slug>` and scopes all queries by `tenantId`. |
| 4 | Error visibility | 8 | 8 | — | High-stakes-audit endpoint surfaces evidence; doesn't change generation. |
| 5 | Documentation hygiene | 9 | 9 | — | AUDIT_PLAN ritual + OPERATIONS cross-link. |
| 6 | Repo security posture | 8 | 8 | — | No identifier leaks in commits (twice slipped values into shell output during this session — flagged at the time, never committed). |
| 7 | **Production verification discipline** | **9** | **9** | — | Caught the silent-deploy-failure latent landmine. Without that catch, the next container restart would have hit `process.exit(1)` on missing env. Worth a +1 in spirit, but didn't change the rubric. |
| 8 | Seller/Buyer contact data model | 8 | 8 | — | No change. |

Average **8.625/10** (unchanged). Blocker #2 is now positioned to close
in the next session via the ritual.

### Session 64 — Pre-Scaling Cleanup Wave (2026-05-01) — 5/5 phases shipped

Foundation work between v1.1 close (Session 63) and the next large
feature sprint. Audit at end of Session 63 surfaced a small backlog
of cleanup items that would compound into foot-guns once features
landed faster. All 5 phases completed in one session, each phase its
own commit + push cycle.

**Phase 1 (commit `c1bcc5f`) — formatCurrency consolidation:**
- Audit said "duplicate exports with mismatched types" — investigation
  revealed both functions were dead code (0 callers in repo).
- Dropped `formatCurrency` from `lib/utils.ts:13`. Kept `lib/format.ts`
  version (`string | null` return — safer for null-coalescing).
- 1 file changed, 12 lines removed. Typecheck clean.

**Phase 2 (commit `8c78047`) — Anthropic + Resend env centralization:**
- Audit estimated 8 inline `new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY! })`
  sites; actual count was 15 across `lib/ai/`, `app/api/`, `scripts/audit.ts`.
- New `config/anthropic.ts` exports a single client built from `env`.
  All 15 callers refactored. `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/buyers/route.ts`
  loses its dynamic `await import('@anthropic-ai/sdk')` shim.
  `app/api/ai/assistant/route.ts` keeps a type-only import for
  `Anthropic.MessageParam`.
- Resend was wider than expected: `lib/email/index.ts` already centralized
  the Resend SDK usage but `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts` duplicated
  it inline. Rather than create a parallel `config/email.ts`, added
  `sendPasswordReset()` to the existing helper and routed reset-password
  through it. `lib/email/index.ts` now imports from `config/env` instead
  of reading `process.env.RESEND_API_KEY` directly.
- Added `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional) + `EMAIL_FROM` (default) to
  `config/env.ts` schema.
- 19 files changed, 58 insertions / 76 deletions. Net negative LOC.

**Phase 3 (commit `3077fe4`) — top-N silent catches → logFailure:**
- Baseline 71 silent catches (down from 79 at Session 33). Target ≤62.
- 11 fixes across 3 reliability-critical files:
  - `lib/grading-processor.ts` (6 catches): heartbeat audit writes →
    `console.error` fallbacks per AGENTS.md mandate; link-backfill SQL,
    claim-reset on grade error, and legacy-job cleanup → `logFailure()`.
    Added `import { logFailure } from '@/lib/audit'`.
  - `app/api/webhooks/ghl/route.ts` (3 catches): tenantId backfill +
    success/failure outcome writes → `logFailure()` (failure-path
    preserves `originalError` context).
  - `lib/ghl/webhooks.ts` (2 catches): `triggerWorkflows` on
    `task_completed` + `buyer.deactivate` on contact-delete → `logFailure()`.
- Skipped: client-side optimistic UI catches, GHL `getContact(...).catch(() => null)`
  batch fan-outs (null is the designed signal), script-side polling/dump
  utilities (failure is loud at the call site), `lib/workflows/engine.ts`
  side-effect catches.
- Final count: 60 (down 11 from 71, target ≤62 met by 2).
- 3 files changed, 12 insertions / 11 deletions. Typecheck clean.

**Phase 4 (commit `1f5d42b`) — health-check field-source migration:**
- `app/api/health/route.ts` was running a one-time `'ai' → 'api'`
  field_source rename on every request via `fixOldAiSources()`. The
  boot-flag (`sourcesFixed`) prevented a full table scan on each call,
  but the patch was still wired in.
- New `scripts/migrate-field-source-ai-to-api.ts` (idempotent, has
  `--apply` flag, default mode is dry-run).
- Production dry-run via `railway run`: **386 properties scanned, 0
  needing fix.** The runtime patch had already drained its work; no
  apply needed. Script preserved for the next time field_sources
  values drift.
- Removed `fixOldAiSources()` + `sourcesFixed` flag from health route.
  `/api/health` is back to a pure `SELECT 1` + boot-time webhook
  re-registration.
- Live verification post-deploy: `GET /api/health` returns HTTP 200,
  body `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`.
- 2 files changed, 54 insertions / 29 deletions.

**Phase 5 (commit `fa37afb`) — scripts/REGISTRY.md:**
- 57 scripts in `scripts/` — `docs/OPERATIONS.md` already categorized
  them but not per-script. New developers and future Claude sessions
  couldn't tell at a glance which scripts are idempotent, when each
  last ran, or which are deletable.
- New `scripts/REGISTRY.md` adds per-script rows with columns:
  `Script | Purpose | Idempotent? | Last Run | Safe to delete after`.
  Cross-linked from `docs/OPERATIONS.md` "Operational scripts" header.
- Sweep candidates flagged for re-evaluation **≥ 2026-06-01** if not
  run in the next 30 days:
  - `scripts/reset-processing.ts` — superseded by rescue sweep in
    `lib/grading-processor.ts:69-72`.
  - `scripts/flip-failed-to-pending.ts` — superseded by
    `scripts/recover-stuck-calls.ts`.
  - `scripts/check-progress.ts` — overlaps with
    `scripts/daily-health-check.ts`.
- 2 files changed, 134 insertions / 1 deletion.

**Verification routine status:** Scheduled for 2026-05-02 ~17:00 UTC
(after this session). Today is 2026-05-01 — routine has not fired
yet. Carry-forward to Session 65: read its result before starting
work. URL: https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01TFP5vnSKsM2RWJiCBxRxN4

**Discipline gates upheld:**
- One commit per phase (each phase reviewable + revertable independently).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed before every push (pre-push hook enforced).
- Class-4 helper rule: no new helpers added that take a record id
  without `tenantId` — `logFailure()` (existing helper) takes
  `tenantId` as the first positional arg already.
- Hybrid commit pattern for Phase 4: code + diagnostic shipped first,
  dry-run against production confirmed 0 changes needed, runtime
  patch removed in same commit.

**Reliability scorecard delta (post-cleanup, vs post-v1.1 baseline
from Session 63):**

| # | Dimension | v1.1 | Session 64 | Δ | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Call ingestion | 9 | 9 | — | Heartbeat fallbacks for `cron.process_recording_jobs.*` audit writes are explicit (`console.error` instead of swallowed). |
| 2 | Grading pipeline | 9 | 9 | — | Same — claim-reset failures now surface to audit_logs. |
| 3 | Multi-tenancy | 9 | 9 | — | No change. logFailure already takes tenantId positionally. |
| 4 | **Error visibility** | **7** | **8** | **+1** | Silent-catch baseline 71 → 60. Top-3 reliability-critical paths (grading-processor, webhook router, ghl/webhooks) audit-logged. |
| 5 | Documentation hygiene | 9 | 9 | — | scripts/REGISTRY.md added; OPERATIONS.md cross-link added. |
| 6 | Repo security posture | 8 | 8 | — | Resend + Anthropic env reads centralized through config/env.ts (Phase 2). |
| 7 | Production verification discipline | 9 | 9 | — | Phase 4 dry-run + post-deploy probe followed standard ritual. |
| 8 | Seller/Buyer contact data model | 8 | 8 | — | No change — Q4 in-flight unlinks (216) and matchScore-fallback are the v1.2 candidates. |

All ≥7/10. Average **8.625/10** (vs 8.5/10 post-v1.1).

**Files modified by this session (cumulative across 6 commits):**
- `lib/utils.ts` (Phase 1)
- `config/anthropic.ts` (new), `config/env.ts`, `lib/email/index.ts`,
  `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`, 14 Anthropic-using files (Phase 2)
- `lib/grading-processor.ts`, `app/api/webhooks/ghl/route.ts`,
  `lib/ghl/webhooks.ts` (Phase 3)
- `app/api/health/route.ts`,
  `scripts/migrate-field-source-ai-to-api.ts` (new) (Phase 4)
- `scripts/REGISTRY.md` (new), `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (Phase 5)
- `PROGRESS.md` (this session-close commit)

### Session 63 — v1.1 Wave 6 (2026-05-01) — sprint COMPLETE + scorecard rescore

Final wave of the v1.1 Seller/Buyer redesign. Verification + handoff.
No new code; pure documentation + scorecard rescore. v1.1 sprint
**CLOSED** with this commit.

**Reliability scorecard — post-v1.1 (vs the post-v1-finish baseline
from Session 59):**

| # | Dimension | v1-finish | v1.1 | Δ | What changed in v1.1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Call ingestion (webhook + polling) | 9 | 9 | — | No regression. |
| 2 | Grading pipeline | 9 | 9 | — | No regression. Q4 auto-link extended the post-grade fan-out without disturbing the sole-driver grading worker. |
| 3 | Multi-tenancy | 9 | 9 | — | Class-4 helper rule reinforced — 4 new helpers hardened in v1.1 (sync-seller, courtlistener × 2, calculateTCP, seller_rollup, call_seller_autolink, wave_4_backfill). PropertySeller no-tenantId-column pattern documented in AGENTS.md. |
| 4 | Error visibility | 7 | 7 | — | No structural change. Silent-catch baseline still 73. |
| 5 | Documentation hygiene | 8 | 9 | +1 | Wave 1+4+5 schema-change log entries; 4 new wave-status banners in SELLER_BUYER_PLAN; OPERATIONS diagnostic endpoint table now includes 2 v1.1 endpoints with operational notes (Railway proxy timeout lesson captured). |
| 6 | Repo security posture | 8 | 8 | — | No new identifiers leaked. Wave 5 dropped some attack-surface columns (manual_buyer_ids JSON could have held PII). |
| 7 | Production verification discipline | 9 | 9 | — | All v1.1 waves verified live before close (Wave 2 backfill applied + idempotency checked; Wave 4 apply across 2 POSTs + idempotency checked; Wave 5 post-deploy diagnostic smoke). |
| 8 | **Seller/Buyer contact data model** | **4** | **8** | **+4** | Sellers + Buyers are now first-class entities with structured names, person flags, portfolio aggregates, motivation + likelihood scores. 117 sellers got populated TCP-equivalent scores in Wave 4 apply. PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore is the per-property fit. Wave 5 strip closed the dual-representation. **Target met.** |

All ≥7/10. Average 8.5/10 (vs 8.25/10 post-v1-finish).

**What keeps dim #8 at 8 not 10:**
- 216 in-flight calls remain unlinked (Q4 helper requires Seller to
  exist; new-lead pipeline creates Property + ghlContactId before
  Seller). A nightly retroactive sweep cron would close this; not
  shipped this sprint.
- 4,135 calls have no propertyId at all (legacy data without lead
  attribution). Name-match auto-link fallback is v1.2 candidate.
- Day Hub task auto-generation from Buy Signal — surface (Session 61)
  but no cron yet.
- Post-grade live-verified audit-log evidence on a freshly graded
  call: scheduled remote agent fires 2026-05-02 ~17:00 UTC and will
  surface verdict.

These are deferred work, not architectural debt.

**v1.1 sprint timeline:**
- 2026-04-30 — Sessions 60+61 (Waves 1-4 apply)
- 2026-05-01 — Sessions 62+63 (Wave 5 strip + Wave 6 close)
- 4 calendar days, ~2 sessions/day, 11 commits on `main`

**Final commit roster (v1.1 only):**

| SHA | Wave | What |
|---|---|---|
| (Session 60) | 1 | Additive schema migration |
| (Session 60) | 2 | Backfill code + applied |
| (Session 60) | 3a | Sellers list + nav |
| 92952f8 | 3b | Sellers tab on inventory + manualBuyerIds → PropertyBuyerStage |
| 5e39ceb | 4A | Schema + rollup helper |
| eb825f2 | 4B | Prompt + post-grade + TCP |
| b2b2056 | 4C | Backfill diagnostic + matchScore live persistence |
| b7ae6b0 | 4D-pre | Q4 auto-link |
| e20736b | 4D | Apply + handoff docs |
| ed74d3a | 4 | Q6 Buy Signal |
| 94c30bb | 4 | Scorecard delta |
| 2ab3504 | 5 | DESTRUCTIVE strip cutover |
| 30f1d87 | 5 | Wave 5 docs |
| (this commit) | 6 | Sprint close + final scorecard |

**Verification routine** scheduled for 2026-05-02T17:00:00Z is the
last open thread of v1.1; that fires automatically and reports back
in the next session.

### Session 62 — v1.1 Wave 5 (2026-05-01) — Property strip cutover SHIPPED

The contract phase of the expand-contract migration. Drops the legacy
staging columns now that Wave 1+2 backfill, Wave 3 read-path migration,
and Wave 4 AI write-path are all live + applied + verified.

**Pre-cutover protocol followed:**
- `pg_dump` snapshot taken via Railway CLI on `DIRECT_URL` →
  `/tmp/gunner-pre-wave5-20260501T153612Z.sql` (160 MB, 71 tables,
  validated header + tail). Rollback handle if anything breaks:
  `railway run --service Gunner-Claude bash -c 'psql "$DIRECT_URL" < /tmp/gunner-pre-wave5-20260501T153612Z.sql'`
- Read-path migration shipped in the same commit (no UI references the
  dropped columns post-cutover; post-cutover grep returned 0 hits).
- Dual-write window closed BEFORE the schema strip — the destructive
  migration runs against a quiet write surface.

**DROP set (24 columns + 2 indexes across 3 tables):**

| Table | Columns dropped |
|---|---|
| `properties` | `owner_phone`, `owner_email`, `owner_type`, `ownership_length_years`, `second_owner_name`, `second_owner_phone`, `second_owner_email`, `owner_first_name_1`, `owner_last_name_1`, `owner_first_name_2`, `owner_last_name_2`, `owner_portfolio_count`, `owner_portfolio_total_equity`, `owner_portfolio_total_value`, `owner_portfolio_total_purchase`, `owner_portfolio_avg_assessed`, `owner_portfolio_avg_purchase`, `owner_portfolio_avg_year_built`, `owner_portfolio_json`, `senior_owner`, `deceased_owner`, `cash_buyer_owner`, `manual_buyer_ids` |
| `properties` indexes | `@@index([senior_owner])`, `@@index([deceased_owner])` (auto-removed by Postgres alongside their columns) |
| `buyers` | `match_likelihood_score` (Q7 lock — replaced by `PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore`) |

**Q3 keeps on Property** (property facts, not person facts):
`absenteeOwner`, `absenteeOwnerInState`, `samePropertyMailing`,
`mailingAddressVacant`.

**Read-path migration (5 files):**
- `components/inventory/property-detail-client.tsx` — `VendorIntelPanel`
  now computes `const primarySeller = property.sellers.find(s => s.isPrimary) ?? property.sellers[0]`
  and reads owner-side flags + portfolio aggregates from `primarySeller.*`
  instead of `property.*`. PropertyDetail interface trimmed of 8 fields.
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/inventory/[propertyId]/page.tsx` — server-component
  Prisma select clause + serialization stripped of the dropped fields.
  The Sellers tab (Wave 3 Phase B) is the canonical surface.
- `components/buyers/buyer-detail-client.tsx` — dropped the per-buyer
  Match Likelihood field row. (Per-property fit lives on
  `PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore`, surfaced wherever the property-buyer
  pair is rendered.)
- `scripts/enrichment-gaps.ts`, `scripts/check-todays-leads.ts` — Prisma
  selects on dropped fields cleaned up.

**Dual-write turn-off (2 files):**
- `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts` — removed all `setIfEmpty` calls for the
  dropped Property.owner_* columns. Vendor data flows to Seller via
  `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts` (the canonical write path, kept).
  Type interface fields trimmed.
- `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts` — Prisma select clauses pruned.

**Dead-code removal (3 deletions):**
- `lib/v1_1/wave_2_backfill.ts` (Wave 2 Property→Seller backfill;
  applied 2026-04-30; source columns dropped this wave so the file
  was uncompilable.)
- `lib/v1_1/wave_4_backfill.ts` (Wave 4 Buyer.matchLikelihoodScore →
  PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore copy; applied 2026-04-30 as a no-op
  — no source data existed; source column dropped this wave.)
- `app/api/diagnostics/v1_1_seller_backfill/route.ts` (Wave 2
  diagnostic endpoint; depended on the deleted lib above).

**Diagnostic endpoint trimmed:**
- `app/api/diagnostics/v1_1_seller_rollup_backfill/route.ts` no longer
  invokes the matchScore copy job. The auto-link + seller-rollup phases
  remain, supporting any future recovery scenarios.

**Verification (pre-push):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors
- Post-cutover grep `property\.\(ownerPhone\|ownerEmail\|...\)`: **0 hits**
- DB snapshot completed before push (160 MB, valid PostgreSQL dump)

**Post-deploy verification:**
- (filled in after deploy completes)

**What's left for Wave 6 (verification + handoff):**
- Reliability scorecard rescore — dim #8 target 8/10 (was 4/10 pre-v1.1, 6/10 after Wave 4)
- Final SYSTEM_MAP / OPERATIONS / AGENTS sweep
- Q6 Seller Buy Signal Day Hub task auto-generation (deferred; surface-only landed Session 61)
- Optional name-match auto-link fallback for the 4,135 calls without propertyId (v1.2 candidate)

### Session 61 — v1.1 Wave 4 (2026-04-30) — AI enrichment routing + Q4/Q5/Q7 closed

Wave 4 routes the AI enrichment pipeline to write to typed Seller columns
(motivationPrimary, urgencyScore, hardshipType, person flags, scores)
instead of the Property.dealIntel JSON blob. Five commits on `main`:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `5e39ceb` | Commit A — `PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore` + `matchScoreUpdatedAt` columns (additive migration `20260430130000_v1_1_wave_4_property_buyer_stage_match_score`) + Class-4 hardened seller rollup helper at `lib/v1_1/seller_rollup.ts` (post-grade rollup logic AND backfill orchestration). Uses existing `Call.sellerMotivation` / `Call.sentiment` columns — no new Claude calls needed for backfill. |
| `eb825f2` | Commit B — `extract-deal-intel.ts` system prompt extended with seller-targeted `target` field + new VALID FIELD NAMES section + Q5 mirror-write (probate/divorce/bankruptcy emit two proposals: target=property + target=seller). PATCH handler at `app/api/[tenant]/calls/[id]/deal-intel/` dispatches `target='seller'` to typed Seller columns. `calculateTCP(propertyId)` → `calculateTCP(tenantId, propertyId)` — Class-4 hardened — and now fan-fires `rollupSellerFromCalls` for every linked Seller after writing Property.tcpScore. Post-grade flow in `lib/ai/grading.ts` fires the rollup. **Prompt cache invalidated** by the system prompt change. |
| `b2b2056` | Commit C — bearer-gated diagnostic at `/api/diagnostics/v1_1_seller_rollup_backfill` + `lib/v1_1/wave_4_backfill.ts` (`backfillBuyerMatchScores` copies `Buyer.matchLikelihoodScore` → `PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore`). Live persistence in `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/buyers/route.ts` GET — fire-and-forget update of `matchScore` for buyers that already have a stage row (no row creation; that would scale poorly). |
| `b7ae6b0` | Commit D-pre — closes Q4. New helper `lib/v1_1/call_seller_autolink.ts` (`autolinkCallSeller` + `backfillCallSellerLinks`). Wired into post-grade flow BEFORE extract/rollup so newly graded calls auto-link via unique `(propertyId, ghlContactId)` match. Also wired into the diagnostic endpoint (auto-link → rollup → matchScore order; auto-link must precede rollup). PropertySeller has no `tenantId` column; both sides scoped via `property.tenantId` + `seller.tenantId` in WHERE. |
| `<this commit>` | Commit D — doc updates only. PROGRESS + OPERATIONS + plan + AGENTS. |

**Q5 lock (mirror-write legal-distress flags):** locked 2026-04-30 mid-
session per recommendation. The AI prompt emits TWO proposedChanges for
each call mention of probate/divorce/bankruptcy: one with
`target='property'`, `field='in*'` and one with `target='seller'`,
`field='is*'`. Foreclosure has no Property mirror — Seller-only.
hasRecentEviction has no Seller mirror — Property-only. Once true,
the prompt instructs never auto-flip to false unless the seller
explicitly retracts. Inventory legal-distress filter keeps working
because the PATCH handler also writes the typed `Property.in*` column
on approve (in addition to the dealIntel JSON). Plan §11 Q5 ✅
RESOLVED.

**Q4 lock (auto-link calls by ghlContactId):** locked mid-session after
the dry-run revealed the rollup was a no-op without it (Wave 2 created
Sellers AFTER calls had landed, so no historical `Call.sellerId` was
set). Implemented per plan §6 recommendation: link only when
exactly one PropertySeller match exists for the call's
`(propertyId, ghlContactId)` pair. 0 / 2+ matches stay null +
audit-logged. Plan §11 Q4 ✅ RESOLVED.

**Q7 lock (matchScore migration):** `PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore` is
the new home (per-property fit). `Buyer.matchLikelihoodScore` keeps
existing for backward-compat; drops in Wave 5. `Buyer.buyerScore`
unchanged (cross-portfolio reliability). Plan §11 Q7 ✅ RESOLVED.

**Apply landed (across two POST calls — first call hit Railway edge proxy
first-byte timeout at 6+ min, but Node process kept writing in background;
second call was idempotent confirmation):**

| Job | Result |
|---|---|
| Auto-link backfill | **3,244 calls linked** (3,442 expected; ~6 calls landed after the apply window via runtime auto-link). 0 ambiguous. 0 errors. |
| Seller rollup backfill | **289 sellers updated**. Of those: 117 got `motivationScore`, 117 got `likelihoodToSellScore`, 77 got `objectionProfile`, 131 got `redFlags`, 128 got `positiveSignals`. All 289 got `totalCallCount` + `lastContactDate`. The 172 sellers without scores have only legacy graded calls where `Call.sellerMotivation` was null. |
| Buyer matchScore backfill | 0 updated. Live tenant has 2 PropertyBuyerStage rows; neither buyer has a source `matchLikelihoodScore`. Live persistence on next inventory page load will populate organically. |
| Audit log | `v1_1_wave_4_rollup_backfill.applied` written with full counts payload. Per-link audit rows: `v1_1_call_seller_autolink.linked`. |

**Spot-check verified populated (sample of 10 sellers from apply payload):**

| Seller | Calls | motivationScore | likelihoodToSellScore |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jennifer Giesy | 11 | 0.40 | 0.44 |
| Brad Houston | 3 | 0.2577 | 0.3865 |
| Phyllis Winkle | 35 | (legacy calls — null sellerMotivation) | — |

**Final verify dry-run after apply:** rollup `wouldUpdate=0/300`,
matchScore `wouldUpdate=0/2`. Idempotency confirmed.

**Reliability scorecard delta — dim #8 (Seller/Buyer data model)**:
suggested **4 → 6/10 after Wave 4**. Movement attributable to:

| Contribution | Source |
|---|---|
| 117 active sellers now have populated motivation + likelihood scores (from 0 pre-Wave-4) | Apply landed |
| 3,244 calls auto-linked to Sellers (from 0 historical links) | Q4 closure |
| Per-call AI extraction writes to typed Seller columns (was JSON blob) | Commit B prompt extension |
| `PropertyBuyerStage.matchScore` is the canonical per-property fit (was `Buyer.matchLikelihoodScore` — wrong unit) | Commit A schema |
| Buy Signal surfaced on /sellers/ list (high motivation × stale contact) | Q6 closure |

What still keeps dim #8 under 8/10 (the Wave 5+6 target):
- Schema dual-representation (Property.owner_* + Seller fields both
  populated) — Wave 5 strip closes this.
- 4,135 historical calls cannot be auto-linked because they have no
  `propertyId`. A name-matching fallback could pick up some of these
  but is out of v1.1 scope.
- Day Hub task auto-generation from Buy Signal — surfaced manually
  today; needs cron integration.
- Post-grade rollup live-verified on a freshly graded call — the code
  path is shipped + the backfill proves the helpers work; awaiting
  next real graded call to write the audit-log evidence.

Formal rescore happens in Wave 6 verification; this is the suggested
delta until then.

**Surprises this session:**
- Original kickoff framed Q4 as "carry-forward, don't block on it." But
  Wave 4 acceptance criteria ("live tenant has populated motivationScore
  on Sellers with 3+ calls") could not be met without it — Wave 2
  populated Sellers AFTER calls had landed, so no `Call.sellerId` was
  set on any historical call. Closing Q4 mid-session was the right
  call; surfaced the conflict to Corey, locked, shipped.
- Railway edge proxy first-byte timeout (~6 min) killed the first apply
  HTTP response, but the Node process kept writing in the background
  and completed all the auto-link writes (~3,242 of 3,442 expected).
  The second POST was idempotent confirmation — only 2 new linkages and
  1 new rollup diff. **Operational lesson**: long-running diagnostic
  applies should stream progress or split into phases. Will note in
  OPERATIONS.md so future Wave 5+ applies design around this.
- `PropertySeller` has no `tenantId` column. Both sides of the join
  carry it (Property + Seller) so scoping via `property: { tenantId }`
  + `seller: { tenantId }` in the WHERE is the correct Class-4 pattern
  for any helper that queries the join table.

### Session 60 — v1.1 Wave 1 + Wave 2 + Wave 3 Phase A + Phase B (2026-04-30)

**Wave 3 Phase B (after Phase A):** Property-side read-path migration
+ Sellers tab on inventory detail. Three load-bearing changes:

| Surface | Change |
|---|---|
| `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/buyers/route.ts` | `getManualBuyers` action now reads from `PropertyBuyerStage(source='manual')` joined to `Buyer`. Removed the GHL-fetch-per-id slow path entirely (Buyer rows already locally cached via `syncBuyerFromGHL` webhook). The `addBuyer` POST flow no longer writes to `Property.manualBuyerIds[]` — instead it inserts a `PropertyBuyerStage` row with `source='manual', stage='added'` (idempotent). The legacy column stays populated for historical rows but is no longer the read source. Wave 5 drops the column. |
| `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/inventory/[propertyId]/page.tsx` | Server-component select clause expanded to fetch the linked Seller's Wave 1+2 fields (decomposed name parts, skip-trace fallback identity, person flags, portfolio aggregates, motivation + urgency + likelihoodToSellScore + lastContactDate + totalCallCount + DNC flag). Serialized through to the client. |
| `components/inventory/property-detail-client.tsx` | New top-level `Sellers` tab (sits between `Data` and `Buyers` in the tab strip). Renders one card per linked Seller with: decomposed name, person flag pills (Senior / Cash Buyer / DNC / Deceased), GHL contact link, motivation + urgency + last-contact stats, portfolio totals, skip-traced mail address. Each card links out to `/sellers/[id]` for the full detail page. `PropertyDetail.sellers` type expanded with all Wave 1+2 fields. |

**Phase B changes shipping per file:**
- `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/buyers/route.ts` — getManualBuyers refactored, addBuyer POST writes PropertyBuyerStage instead of manualBuyerIds.
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/inventory/[propertyId]/page.tsx` — Seller select expanded + serialization expanded (~22 new fields per linked seller).
- `components/inventory/property-detail-client.tsx` — TabKey gained 'sellers', TABS array gained Sellers entry, body-render block added, `SellersTab` component (~120 lines) added before `BuyersTab`. PropertyDetail.sellers type expanded.

**Skipped from plan:**
- Read-path migration of property-detail-client.tsx's ~30 `property.owner*` render points. Discovered post-grep: most matches were false positives (Seller-side reads). The actual remaining sites are inside the existing legacy "owner" cards on the Data tab, which still render from Property until Wave 5. These work as-is; rendering switch can land in a Wave 4/5 cleanup pass since the new Sellers tab provides the canonical surface. Property.manualBuyerIds and Property.owner_* drops will land in Wave 5 with the Property-strip migration.
- P6 (View-As cookie + server-side resolution) — deferred. The new Sellers tab is read-only and renders server-side data passed through props (no new View-As-keyed fetch). Wave 6.2 fix already protects the existing surfaces. P6 stays queued for any future client component that introduces View-As-keyed state.

**Wave 3 Phase A (after Wave 2 applied):** UI surfaces for the new
schema. The new fields are now visible to users via:

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| `/{tenant}/sellers/` (list view) | **NEW** — server component, ranked by `likelihoodToSellScore DESC, lastContactDate DESC`. Renders decomposed name + person flag pills (Senior / Deceased / Cash buyer) + portfolio totals (`totalPropertiesOwned`, `ownerPortfolioTotalEquity`). Uses `requireSession` + `hasPermission('properties.view.assigned')`. |
| `/{tenant}/sellers/[id]/` | Polished. Server component now serializes the 5 new portfolio Decimal fields. Detail client gains Wave 1+2 type fields + a compact "decomposed name + portfolio summary" sub-row in the header (only visible when backfilled data exists). Person flag pills appear inline next to the existing DNC pill. |
| Top nav | "Sellers" link added (visible to anyone with `properties.view.assigned`). "Buyers" link added (admin-only — was previously hidden from nav per PROGRESS Built table). |
| `/{tenant}/buyers/page.tsx` | NO change. Plan §3 said "migrate from `requireSession()` to `withTenant`" but that was a planning error: `withTenant` is for API routes; server pages correctly use `requireSession()`. The existing surface is fine. |

**Wave 3 Phase B (DEFERRED to next session — fresh context):**
- Property Research tab gains Sellers + Buyers sub-tabs.
- Read-path migration of ~30 sites currently reading `property.owner*`
  → switch to read from linked Seller (Property staging columns drop in
  Wave 5).
- Optional: P6 (View-As cookie + server-side resolution) before any
  new client component reading View-As state.

**Files added:**
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/sellers/page.tsx` (NEW server component, ~240 lines).

**Files modified:**
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/sellers/[id]/page.tsx` — added 5 Decimal-to-string conversions for portfolio columns.
- `components/sellers/seller-detail-client.tsx` — `SellerData` type gained 17 Wave 1+2 fields; header gained person flag pills + a compact "decomposed name + portfolio summary" sub-row (only renders when populated, so legacy sellers don't show empty placeholders).
- `components/ui/top-nav.tsx` — added Sellers + Buyers nav items.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors.
- Live walkthrough deferred to post-deploy (will spot-check after push).

**Wave 2 commit 2 (apply, after dry-run review approved by Corey):**
Backfill APPLIED via `POST /api/diagnostics/v1_1_seller_backfill`. Live
production database now reflects:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Properties scanned (with owner data) | 15 |
| Sellers updated | 16 (across 15 properties; 1 prop has 2 linked sellers — co-owner) |
| Total field writes | 221 |
| Skipped (no linked Seller) | 0 |
| Errors | 0 |
| Apply duration | 1.6 s |
| Idempotency check | PASS — re-run dry-run shows wouldUpdate=0, alreadyComplete=15 |
| Audit log | `v1_1_wave_2_backfill.applied` written with full counts payload |

**Manual buyer IDs migration:** No-op for this tenant — `Property.manualBuyerIds[]`
is empty across all 15 properties. (`PropertyBuyerStage.source='manual'` path
is still wired up; will engage on any future tenant where the JSON-array
hack is in use.)

**Wave 2 commit 1 (this session, after Wave 1):** Dual-write turn-on +
bearer-gated diagnostic endpoint. **NO apply yet** — gated on dry-run
review.

**Constraint locked by Corey 2026-04-30:** No auto-create of Sellers or
Buyers in this wave. Backfill only updates entities that already have
the right relationship:
- Sellers: only those linked via `PropertySeller`. Properties with owner
  data but no linked Seller are SKIPPED + logged for manual creation.
- `PropertyBuyerStage` rows from `Property.manualBuyerIds[]`: only when
  a `Buyer` row with the matching `ghlContactId` already exists.
  Otherwise SKIPPED + logged.

**Files added:**
- `lib/v1_1/wave_2_backfill.ts` — backfill logic exposed as two functions:
  - `backfillSellersFromProperty(tenantId, opts)` — fills empty Seller
    columns from linked Property's owner data (name parts, skip-trace
    fallback identity, portfolio aggregates, person flags). Idempotent.
  - `migrateManualBuyerIdsForTenant(tenantId, opts)` — converts JSON
    array into PropertyBuyerStage rows with `stage='added'`,
    `source='manual'`. Idempotent.
- `app/api/diagnostics/v1_1_seller_backfill/route.ts` — bearer-token
  gated control surface. GET = dry-run, POST = apply. Both produce a
  detailed report (counts, fields touched, samples, skipped samples,
  errors). Apply runs additionally write an audit_logs row with action
  `v1_1_wave_2_backfill.applied`.

**Files modified for dual-write:**
- `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts:buildSellerSyncUpdate` extended:
  - SellerSlice interface gained 16 new fields.
  - Now writes name parts (`firstName`/`middleName`/`lastName`) on every
    vendor enrichment. Prefers PropertyRadar's structured form
    (`ownerFirstName1`/`ownerLastName1`); falls back to `splitName`.
  - Mirrors `phone`/`email` writes into `skipTracedPhone`/`skipTracedEmail`,
    and `mailing*` into `skipTracedMailing*`. Legacy columns keep being
    written through Wave 5 cutover.
  - Person flags (`seniorOwner`/`deceasedOwner`/`cashBuyerOwner`) and
    portfolio aggregates write only on ordinal=1 (owner-of-record).
  - `setIfEmpty` semantics preserved — never overwrites existing values.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors.
- Endpoint inert until `DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN` set (matches dial-counts
  pattern). PUBLIC_PATHS in middleware.ts already covers
  `/api/diagnostics`.

**Next:** deploy → curl GET dry-run → Corey reviews report → curl POST
apply (Wave 2 commit 2). Then Wave 3 (read-path migration).

### Session 60 — v1.1 Wave 1 (2026-04-30) — Seller/Buyer additive schema shipped

First wave of v1.1 Seller/Buyer redesign. PLAN-FIRST kickoff happened
earlier in the same calendar day (commits `44edc9c` + `6775d7b`); Corey
reviewed, locked Q1/Q2/Q3, and authorized Wave 1. This session shipped
Wave 1 in a single commit on `main` (Railway auto-deploy).

**Schema additions (additive only — NO drops):**

| Table | Cols added | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sellers` | +17 | Q2 name parts (`first_name`, `middle_name`, `last_name`, `name_suffix`) + Q1/Shape A skip-trace fallback identity (`skip_traced_phone/email/mailing_address/city/state/zip`) + owner portfolio aggregates moved from Property staging (`owner_portfolio_total_equity/value/purchase`, `owner_portfolio_avg_assessed/purchase/year_built`, `owner_portfolio_json`) + Q3 person flags (`senior_owner`, `deceased_owner`, `cash_buyer_owner`) |
| `buyers` | +5 | Q1/Shape A skip-trace fallback identity (`skip_traced_name/phone/email/company/mailing_address`) |
| `property_buyer_stages` | +1 | `source` column (`'matched'` default) — disambiguates matched-from-buybox vs added-manually post-`Property.manualBuyerIds` strip |
| `properties` | rename | `owner_mailing_vacant` → `mailing_address_vacant` (Q3 lock — clarifies it's a property fact, not a person fact) |

Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260430120000_v1_1_wave_1_seller_buyer_additive/migration.sql`.

**Class-4 helper hardening (3 helpers + 3 caller sites):**

Per AGENTS.md "lib helpers that take ids must take tenantId explicitly."

| Helper | File | Old signature | New signature |
|---|---|---|---|
| `syncSellersFromVendorResult` | `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts` | `(propertyId, result)` | `(propertyId, tenantId, result)` |
| `searchCourtListenerForSeller` | `lib/enrichment/sync-seller-courtlistener.ts` | `(sellerId, opts)` | `(sellerId, tenantId, opts)` |
| `searchCourtListenerForProperty` | `lib/enrichment/sync-seller-courtlistener.ts` | `(propertyId)` | `(propertyId, tenantId)` |

Inner queries refactored: `db.seller.findUnique({ where: { id }})` →
`db.seller.findFirst({ where: { id, tenantId }})`; trailing
`db.seller.update({ where: { id }})` → `{ where: { id, tenantId }}`.

Callers updated: `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts:389,397` (already had
`tenantId` in scope) + `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts:935` (passes
`property.tenantId` selected at line 652). Note:
`enrichPropertyFromBatchData` itself is dead code (no callers found via
grep) and will be deleted in Wave 5 cleanup; minimal touch this session.

**Code-side rename to match Q3 column rename:**
- `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts:154` (Prisma slice interface) — `ownerMailingVacant: boolean | null` → `mailingAddressVacant: boolean | null`
- `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts:488` — first arg of `setIfEmpty` (Prisma column key)
- `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts:705` (Prisma select) — `ownerMailingVacant: true` → `mailingAddressVacant: true`
- `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts:193` (Prisma select) — same
- Vendor adapter types (`lib/batchdata/client.ts:223`, `lib/propertyradar/client.ts:250`) keep `ownerMailingVacant` as the vendor concept; translation happens at the Prisma write boundary

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors.
- Migration SQL hand-written matching past convention (timestamped dir +
  `migration.sql`) — Railway `npm run db:migrate:prod` (= `prisma migrate
  deploy`) applies on next deploy.

**Files changed this session:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Seller/Buyer/PropertyBuyerStage/Property additions + Property rename.
- `prisma/migrations/20260430120000_v1_1_wave_1_seller_buyer_additive/migration.sql` — new.
- `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts` — `syncSellersFromVendorResult` Class-4 hardened.
- `lib/enrichment/sync-seller-courtlistener.ts` — both CourtListener helpers Class-4 hardened.
- `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts` — pass `tenantId` to both helper calls + Prisma select rename.
- `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts` — pass `tenantId` to `syncSellersFromVendorResult` + Prisma column rename (3 sites).
- `docs/v1.1/SELLER_BUYER_PLAN.md` — Wave 1 SHIPPED banner at top.
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` — schema-change log entry.
- `PROGRESS.md` — this entry; Current Status; Next Session pointer (Wave 2).

**Next Session — v1.1 Wave 2 — backfill + dual-write turn-on:**

Wave 1 added the destinations; Wave 2 fills them. Three jobs:

1. **Property → Seller backfill.** For every Property with `ownerPhone` /
   `ownerEmail` / `secondOwnerName` / `ownerFirstName1` / etc. populated,
   match to existing Seller via `Property.ghlContactId →
   Seller.ghlContactId` (or create new Seller row + PropertySeller link
   when no match). Fill Seller's Q1 skip-trace fallback columns +
   Q2 name parts + Q3 person flags + portfolio aggregates from Property.
2. **`Property.manualBuyerIds[]` → `PropertyBuyerStage` rows.** For each
   GHL contact ID in the JSON array, find/create Buyer by `ghlContactId`,
   insert `PropertyBuyerStage` with `stage='added'`, `source='manual'`.
3. **Dual-write turn-on.** `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts:buildSellerSyncUpdate`
   today writes legacy `name/phone/email`; expand to ALSO write
   `firstName/lastName/skipTracedPhone/skipTracedEmail` + portfolio
   aggregates + person flags. PropertyRadar enrichment continues writing
   to `Property.owner*` for now (drops in Wave 5).

Expected effort: 2-3 sprint days. Verifiable via diagnostic endpoint
(`/api/diagnostics/seller-backfill?tenantId=...`) reporting per-property
backfill coverage.

**Surprises this session:**
- The 3 Class-4 helpers were the easy targets I expected — `skipTraceSeller`
  and `skipTraceSellersForProperty` (related helpers in the same file)
  were already hardened in v1-finish Wave 3 Session G commit 1. This
  session closes 3 of the remaining Class-4 vectors in the seller/buyer
  enrichment chain. Other helpers in `lib/` may still need audit
  (deferred to Wave 3 read-path migration).
- `enrichPropertyFromBatchData` in `lib/batchdata/enrich.ts:645` has zero
  callers via grep but is still kept (legacy comment said "in place for
  any existing callers"). Its inner `db.property.update({ where: { id }})`
  is a Class-1 leak — not fixed this session because it would expand
  scope; flagged for Wave 5 cleanup deletion.
- Prisma-shaped slice in `batchdata/enrich.ts:154` had `ownerMailingVacant`
  matching the legacy column name. Vendor-result type
  (`BatchDataPropertyResult`) at `batchdata/client.ts:223` also has
  `ownerMailingVacant` — kept since it's the vendor concept. Translation
  now happens at the `setIfEmpty` write boundary in `buildDenormUpdate`.
- The kickoff prompt's framing of Class-4 audit ("3 helpers — sync-seller,
  sync-seller-courtlistener, lib/buyers/sync") was off by one:
  `lib/buyers/sync.ts:syncBuyerFromGHL` already takes `tenantId` (was
  hardened pre-v1-finish). The actual targets were `syncSellersFromVendorResult`
  + the two CourtListener helpers. Same effort, different surface.

### Session 59 — Wave 7 (2026-04-30) — v1-finish sprint COMPLETE

Final wave. No new code. Verification + handoff to v1.1.

**Reliability scorecard (8 dimensions, post-sprint vs pre-sprint baseline 2026-04-27):**

| # | Dimension | Pre | Post | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Call ingestion (webhook + polling) | 9 | 9 | webhook_logs 1558/1559 success in last 24h (0.06% failed). No regressions. |
| 2 | Grading pipeline | 9 | 9 | Wave 1 closed dual worker; in-process loop sole driver. No new failure modes. |
| 3 | Multi-tenancy | 6 | 9 | Wave 3: 91/91 routes on withTenant, 38 latent gaps fixed, 4 leak classes catalogued, 6 Class 4 helpers hardened. |
| 4 | Error visibility | 7 | 7 | Heartbeat audit rows from Wave 1 still ticking; 73 silent catches remain (down from 79 baseline; queued). No structural change. |
| 5 | Documentation hygiene | 4 | 8 | SYSTEM_MAP / OPERATIONS canonicalized (Session 44); Wave 4 scrubbed prod identifiers; Wave 6 closed cleanly with 3-session arc; Living Map Discipline (Rule 8) codified. |
| 6 | Repo security posture | 3 | 8 | Wave 4 prod identifier scrub (17 sites); Wave 3 cross-tenant defense; Wave 6.2 closed View As intra-tenant leak. |
| 7 | Production verification discipline | 9 | 9 | CLAUDE.md "no phase complete until verified live" rule held throughout. Wave 6 verified by Corey on live URL 2026-04-30. |
| 8 | Seller/Buyer contact data model | 4 | 4 | No change (acceptable). v1.1 sprint target — redesign opens next chat. |

All ≥7/10 except item 8, which is the explicit v1.1 redesign target.

All 9 criteria met. Sprint closes 2026-04-30.

**Sprint totals (across all 7 waves):**
- **Sessions used:** 14 (Sessions 45-58 + this Session 59)
- **Wave count:** 7 (Wave 6 split into 6.1 / 6.2 / closure across 3 sessions)
- **Closure events:** 1 Blocker (#3), 5 P-items closed (P1-P3 + Bug #12 + AGENTS leak-class catalogue), 2 P-items DEFERRED (P4 + P5), 2 P-items QUEUED (P6 + new Bug #25)
- **Latent leaks fixed:** 38 cross-tenant defense gaps (Wave 3) + 1 intra-tenant View As leak (Wave 6.2) = 39
- **Decisions codified:** D-044 (stability-first model rule) accepted; D-045 + D-046 pending driver
- **Files changed (sprint total, by Wave):** Wave 1 = 5; Wave 2 = ~6; Wave 3 = ~110 (bulk migration + helper hardening); Wave 4 = 9; Wave 5 = 2; Wave 6 = 3; Wave 7 = 2 (this session)

**Files changed this session:**
- `PROGRESS.md` — Current Status updated for sprint complete; this entry added; Next Session block rewritten as v1.1 kickoff.
- `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` — Closure SHAs added to P1/P2/P3; P4 + P5 explicitly tagged "DEFERRED — v1.1".

**Surprises:**
- The originally-cited audit doc `GUNNER_AUDIT_2026-04-27.md §10` doesn't
  exist in the repo (only `docs/audits/ACTION_EXECUTION_AUDIT.md` is
  present). The reliability scorecard rescore was grounded in the prompt-
  provided baseline scores rather than a live document — fine for this
  session, but worth knowing if you reference §10 elsewhere.
- silent-catches dropped 79 → 73 organically over the sprint without a
  dedicated sweep — likely from Wave 3 helper hardening removing some
  swallow-and-continue patterns that became `tenantId`-scoped operations
  with explicit error paths. The remaining 73 are predominantly
  fire-and-forget patterns (`.catch(() => {})` after non-blocking work)
  rather than true silent failures, but still worth a structured pass in
  v1.1 hygiene.
- webhook_logs last-24h Health is excellent: 0.06% failure rate is below
  most public web-API SLOs. Bug #25 (the `/api/calls-review-count` 404)
  is fire-and-forget and doesn't appear in webhook_logs since it's a
  client-side fetch, not a webhook ingest.
- Bug #16 ("DEV_BYPASS_AUTH hardcoded slugs") was the closest exit-
  criteria edge case — read literally, "hardcoded slugs" sounds like
  hardcoded creds. Re-reading the bug, it's tenant slugs in dev-bypass
  logic, not real credentials. Counted as MET on criterion 6 with that
  qualification documented above.

### Session 58 — Wave 6 closure (2026-04-30) — V1+V4 verifications passed

Docs-only session closing the Wave 6 arc.

**Browser verifications completed by Corey on 2026-04-30:**
- V1 (no hydration mismatch warning) — PASS. Console clean of React
  hydration warnings. The two console items that did appear (a 404
  on `/api/calls-review-count` and a canvas2d notice) are unrelated
  to the Wave 6.2 fix; logged separately as side bugs.
- V2 (first-paint URL params include `asUserId`) — SKIPPED. DevTools
  Network tab opened too late on first attempt; V4 user-visible
  evidence makes wire-level confirmation redundant.
- V3 (Strict Mode double-invoke safe) — SKIPPED. Folds into V2
  evidence.
- V4 (5+ navigation cycles, zero leak frames) — PASS. Repeated
  navigation as Daniel Lozano showed no owner-data flash on any
  cycle. The user-visible behavioral test is the test that matters;
  V4 is the proof Wave 6.2's race fix works in practice.

V1 + V4 are the strongest pair for this kind of race: V1 rules out a
React-internal symptom and V4 rules out a user-visible symptom. V2/V3
were instrumentation-level checks that V4 already covers in effect.

**Side bugs surfaced from V1 console output:**
- Bug #25 — `GET /[tenantSlug]/api/calls-review-count` 404. Source
  pinpointed to `components/ui/top-nav.tsx:42`. Vestigial
  fire-and-forget fetch with wrong path order; the working
  review-count call lives on line 45 of the same file. One-line
  delete to fix; deferred to v1.1.
- P4 visual confirmation — top nav "Day Hub" link still routes to
  `/tasks/` rather than `/day-hub/`. Already-known per Wave 5 stop;
  Wave 6 walkthrough is the live evidence. Strengthens the case for
  v1.1 P4 sprint without changing P4's status.

**Files changed this session:**
- `PROGRESS.md` — Session 57 verifications checklist updated with
  `[x]/[~]` status; header bumped to Session 58; Bug #25 added to
  Known Bugs table; this entry added.
- `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` — P4 entry annotated with Wave 6 visual
  confirmation note (2026-04-30).

**Surprises:**
- The 404 on `/api/calls-review-count` was almost-invisible: a
  fire-and-forget `fetch().catch(() => null)` so the user sees
  nothing, but it's still a real failed request on every page load.
  The bug had been in `top-nav.tsx` since the badge was added — the
  developer wrote two different fetches, kept the one that worked,
  forgot to delete the other. Wave 6's V1 console inspection was the
  first time anyone looked.
- Wave 6 closure is a clean tri-session arc (56 diagnostic → 57 fix
  → 58 verification). Each session was small and bounded; the whole
  arc cost two doc sessions plus one ten-line code change.

### Session 57 — Wave 6.2 (2026-04-29) — View As hydration race fixed on /tasks/

Closes a reproducible cross-user data leak surfaced during a manual
View-As-LM walkthrough. Single-file fix in
`app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/day-hub-client.tsx`. Shape C (architectural
follow-up) queued, not implemented.

**Wave 6.1 (Session 56) — retroactive diagnostic summary.** No commits;
diagnostic-only session. Reproduction: log in as owner, switch View As →
Daniel via Settings > Team, navigate to `/tasks/`. For ~2 seconds, the
inbox + appointments panels render owner-scoped data (LM-irrelevant calls,
owner appointments) before snapping to Daniel's data. Initial guesses
ruled out:

- NOT a cache leak — `Cache-Control: no-store` already set on the three
  routes; new fetch on every navigation.
- NOT a Wave 3 `withTenant` leak — `tenantId` filtering correct on every
  query; the leak is intra-tenant (owner ↔ LM), not cross-tenant.
- NOT a route handler bug — `/api/[tenant]/dayhub/{kpis,inbox,appointments}`
  all correctly call `resolveEffectiveUser(ctx, asUserId)`; when `asUserId`
  is null they return owner-scoped data per the admin path, which is
  correct behavior given a null input.

Root cause: client hydration race in `day-hub-client.tsx`:

| Lines | What it did |
|---|---|
| 308-309 | `useState<string \| null>(null)` for viewAsUser/viewAsUserId |
| 312-319 | Separate `useEffect` reads localStorage AFTER first render |
| 380-389 | KPI fetch `useEffect` — depends on `viewAsUserId`, fires on mount |
| 400-416 | Inbox fetch `useEffect` — same pattern |
| 438-462 | Appointments fetch `useEffect` — same pattern |

First mount renders all three fetches with `viewAsUserId=null`. URL has
no `?asUserId` param. Routes return owner-scoped data (admin path).
localStorage `useEffect` then commits `viewAsUserId='daniel-id'`, deps
change, three fetches re-fire — LM data replaces owner data on screen.

Scope confirmation:
- `/day-hub/` unaffected — server-rendered data, no View As propagation
  in the client.
- `/calls/` unaffected — uses View As only for admin gating, not for
  fetch scoping.

**Wave 6.2 (this session) — Shape A fix shipped.**

Single edit in `day-hub-client.tsx`:

1. Module-level helper added in the Helpers section:
   ```ts
   function readViewAs(key: string): string | null {
     if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null
     try { return localStorage.getItem(key) } catch { return null }
   }
   ```
2. Synchronous `useState` initializer replaces the `useState(null)` +
   hydration `useEffect` pair:
   ```ts
   const [viewAsUser, setViewAsUser] = useState<string | null>(() =>
     readViewAs('gunner_view_as_user')
   )
   const [viewAsUserId, setViewAsUserId] = useState<string | null>(() =>
     readViewAs('gunner_view_as_user_id')
   )
   ```
3. Hydration `useEffect` deleted. `exitViewAs()` unchanged.

The three data-fetching `useEffect`s already had `viewAsUserId` in their
dep arrays, so they now fire ONCE on mount with the correct value. No
flash, no re-fetch.

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → exit 0.
- Pre-push tsc gate clean.
- Manual browser reproduction (the 7 scenarios in the prompt) is owed by
  Corey on the live Railway URL — Claude cannot drive a browser, so the
  no-flash and no-hydration-warning checks need a human pass.

**Hydration mismatch caveat (Shape A's known cost):** the synchronous
initializer reads localStorage during render. Server render returns
`null` (no `window`); client first render returns the stored value. The
JSX uses `viewAsUser` in conditional branches (lines 502, 640, 661, 685),
so the server HTML and the client's hydration render will disagree
whenever a View-As is active. React 18 will log a hydration mismatch
warning and discard the server tree for this subtree, then re-render
client-side with the correct value. Functionally this is FINE — the data
leak is gone either way — but it is noisy in dev console. This is the
exact reason Shape C is queued: a cookie-based mechanism would let the
server render the correct state on the first byte, eliminating both the
race AND the warning.

**Files changed this session:**
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/day-hub-client.tsx` — readViewAs helper
  (module scope), synchronous useState initializer, hydration useEffect
  removed.
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 57, this entry added.
- `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` — P6 added (Shape C: View-As propagation refactor).

**Surprises:**
- The "first guess" mental model was a Wave 3 cross-tenant leak, but
  Wave 3 is fully closed — the leak was intra-tenant (admin ↔ LM)
  caused by client-side state, not by a route-level scoping bug. Worth
  remembering: not every "wrong data on screen" bug is a tenant leak;
  some are just race conditions in the client.
- The fix is one file and ~10 lines. The diagnostic was the work; the
  patch was a one-liner.

**Verifications (Wave 6.2 fix, browser-side) — completed 2026-04-30:**
- [x] V1: No hydration mismatch warning in dev console
      VERIFIED 2026-04-30 — console clean (404 + canvas2d are unrelated; logged as side bugs)
- [~] V2: First-paint fetches include `&asUserId=`
      SKIPPED — V4 user-visible evidence makes wire-level confirmation redundant
- [~] V3: Strict Mode double-invoke safe
      SKIPPED — folds into V2 evidence
- [x] V4: 5+ navigation cycles, zero leak frames
      VERIFIED 2026-04-30 — Corey confirmed no leak frames across repeated navigation as Daniel Lozano

Status: PASS. Wave 6.2 fix verified sufficient. Wave 6 fully closed.

### Session 55 — Wave 5: cleanup wave (2026-04-29) — P4 STOPPED, Bug #12 closed

Two items in scope: legacy `/tasks/` deletion (P4) and Bug #12 (GHL API
version header verification). Mixed result.

**Part A — Legacy /tasks/ deletion: STOPPED at safety gate.**

Pre-flight inventory revealed multiple active production references that
contradicted the prompt's assumption "no production traffic on /tasks/":

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Nav menu entry pointing to /tasks/ | ❌ FAIL | `components/ui/top-nav.tsx:66` — `{ href: \`${base}/tasks\`, label: 'Day Hub' }` (the visible nav link IS the /tasks/ URL) |
| Active redirects to /tasks/ | ❌ FAIL | 4 sites: `health/page.tsx:14`, `ai-logs/page.tsx:18`, `bugs/page.tsx:18`, `kpis/page.tsx:18` (non-admin redirects) |
| Internal links | ❌ FAIL | `dashboard-client.tsx:276` (link), `settings-client.tsx:487` (router.push) |
| /day-hub/ is a drop-in replacement | ❌ FAIL | The two pages are different products: `/tasks/` (83K) renders GHL tasks via `ghl.searchTasks()`; `/day-hub/` (24K) renders local `db.task` rows. Different data sources, different feature sets (AM/PM tracking, KpiLedgerModal exist only in /tasks/) |

Per prompt instruction "If any check fails, STOP and report. Don't delete
and ask forgiveness", deletion was halted before any file was touched.

AUDIT_PLAN.md P4 entry expanded with the 5-step pre-deletion migration
required (rewire 7 nav/redirect/link sites to `/day-hub`, then audit
`/day-hub/` covers needed functionality, then delete). P4 stays OPEN.

**Part B — Bug #12 (GHL API version header): CLOSED, no code change.**

Inventory of `Version` header usage in repo (13 sites):
- `Version: 2021-07-28` — 11 sites (main LeadConnector API)
- `Version: 2021-04-15` — 2 sites (recording subsystem only;
  documented inline in `lib/ghl/fetch-recording.ts:4` as a separate
  required value for that endpoint plane)

Web verification (HighLevel/LeadConnector docs, 2026):
- [HighLevel marketplace docs](https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/)
  + [Stoplight integrations docs](https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/0443d7d1a4bd0-api-2-0-overview):
  current example curl requests still use `Version: 2021-07-28` as the
  canonical GA value. No newer GA version published.
- The recording-API value `2021-04-15` is unchanged per inline comment
  in `fetch-recording.ts`.

Production live-check (proxy for header acceptance):
- `/api/health` → 200
- All GHL surfaces (enrichment, calendars, contacts, pipelines)
  functional through Wave 4 — would visibly break if 2021-07-28 were
  rejected.

**Verdict**: header values are current. Bug #12 closed in PROGRESS.md
known-bugs table without code changes. Audit doc flag was false-positive.

**Files changed this session:**
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 55, this entry, Bug #12 marked closed.
- `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` — P4 entry expanded with Wave 5 stop notes + 5-step pre-deletion migration plan.

**Surprises:**
- The prompt's mental model of `/tasks/` ("Chris and Daniel still on the
  legacy system, no production traffic") confused USER routing with CODE
  routing. Code wires `Day Hub → /tasks/` regardless of who uses it; any
  Gunner user clicking "Day Hub" lands on the legacy URL. The prompt's
  pre-Wave-2 confirmation appears to have been about user habits, not
  the actual nav wiring.
- The presence of two parallel Day Hub implementations (`/tasks/` GHL-
  backed, `/day-hub/` Gunner-backed) is itself a Wave-2-era artifact
  that was never closed: the canonical helper `lib/kpis/dial-counts.ts`
  is shared, but the page-level migration was incomplete.

### Session 53 — Wave 3 Session G — End-of-Wave-3 cleanup (2026-04-29) — **WAVE 3 FULLY CLOSED**

5 commits, each one concern. Cleanup queue from Session 52 closing notes
fully drained. All 4 items confirmed in-prompt got their dedicated commit.

**Commit 1 (`e63b2a9`) — Class 4 helper signature audit (the big one).**
6 lib helpers that previously did id-only `findUnique` now take
`tenantId: string` as a required parameter:
- `lib/computed-metrics.ts: computePropertyMetrics(propertyId, tenantId)`
- `lib/ai/generate-property-story.ts: generatePropertyStory(propertyId, tenantId)`
- `lib/properties.ts: splitCombinedAddressIfNeeded(propertyId, tenantId)`
- `lib/enrichment/enrich-property.ts: enrichProperty(propertyId, tenantId, opts?)`
- `lib/ai/enrich-property.ts: enrichPropertyWithAI(propertyId, tenantId)`
- `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts: skipTraceSeller(sellerId, tenantId, opts?)`

All internal property/seller queries now scope on tenantId — every
findUnique flipped to findFirst({ id, tenantId }), every update/delete
WHERE includes tenantId. Side effect: `skipTraceSellersForProperty` also
takes tenantId (called from inside enrichProperty); legacy
`enrichPropertyFromBatchData` adapted to pass property.tenantId through
to that inner call.

23 call sites updated:
- 11 routes (properties/{[propertyId]/{metrics,re-enrich,research,story,
  team,...},route.ts}, sellers/[sellerId]/skip-trace,
  ai/assistant/execute, etc.) — all pass `ctx.tenantId`
- 4 lib internals (grading-processor, properties.ts createPropertyFromContact,
  ghl/webhooks, batchdata/enrich) — derive tenantId from local context
- 6 scripts (backfill-today, coverage-probe, reenrich-today,
  regenerate-stories, split-existing-doubles, verify-e2e) — extend
  property selects to include tenantId

Class 4 leak class is now closed at the source. The route-level
`findFirst({ id, tenantId })` gates added during Wave 3 remain in place
for the 404 contract (clear "Not found" before delegating) but are no
longer load-bearing for safety.

**Commit 2 (`0ba786d`) — Extend TenantContext with userName + userEmail.**
TenantContext grew from 4 fields to 6:
`tenantId, userId, userRole, tenantSlug, userName, userEmail`. Drops
3 `getSession()` re-fetches (`ai/coach`, `bugs/route.ts`,
`tenants/invite`). Note: prompt mentioned a 4th re-fetch site —
confirmed only 3 sites exist in migrated routes. `stripe/checkout` uses
`session.name/email` but is a documented exception (pre-tenant flow).

**Commit 3 (`e8a7a19`) — `resolveEffectiveUser` accepts TenantContext.**
Drops legacy AppSession duck typing. 4 callers updated to pass `ctx`
directly: `calls/ledger`, `dayhub/inbox`, `dayhub/appointments`,
`dayhub/kpis`. After this commit: zero `getSession()` calls remain in
any migrated route.

**Commit 4 (`c688316`) — `ctx` redundancy sweep.** Final pass through
91 migrated routes. 1 new redundancy drop found:
`ai/assistant/route.ts` was doing
`db.user.findUnique({ id: userId, select: { name: true } })` purely to
populate the assistant's system prompt — now uses `ctx.userName`. All
other `db.user.findFirst` calls in migrated routes are legitimate
(global email collision check, target-user validation, finding *other*
users by name for delegation tools). All `db.tenant.findUnique` calls
are legitimate (fetching tokens, config, name — fields not in ctx).

Wave 3 cumulative redundancy drops: **12 total** (4 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1).

**Commit 5 (this commit) — Codify architectural patterns in AGENTS.md.**
Two patterns surfaced during Wave 3 where routes look warm under the
find/write pre-scan heuristic but are structurally safe:

1. **DiD-via-FK** (defense-in-depth via foreign key) — when a route
   validates the parent record's tenant boundary once at the top of
   every handler, all downstream operations on FK-scoped child records
   are implicitly tenant-scoped. Canonical example:
   `properties/[propertyId]/sellers/route.ts` (8 DB ops, 0 leaks).
2. **Tenant-table-as-boundary** — the `Tenant` table's `id` column IS
   the tenant boundary, so id-only WHERE on Tenant is structurally safe.
   Canonical examples: `tenants/config`, `ghl/calendars`. Does NOT
   extend to other tables.

Both patterns added to AGENTS.md Route Conventions to prevent false-leak
flags during future audits.

Plus updated to AGENTS.md Class 4 entry: noted that all 6 helpers have
been refactored to take tenantId; route-level gates remain for 404
contract but are no longer load-bearing.

Plus AUDIT_PLAN.md: flipped "withTenant migration" item from queued
to ✅ CLOSED with full Wave 3 summary.

**Note re Bug #16**: prompt mentioned "Bug #16 (dev creds pending —
confirm this is closed too)" — searched PROGRESS.md and SESSION_ARCHIVE
for #16 reference; doesn't exist (active bugs are #17-23). Treating
as a phantom reference; nothing to flip.

**Cleanup commits summary:**

| Commit | Files changed | Insertions | Deletions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `e63b2a9` Class 4 helpers | 23 | 84 | 72 |
| `0ba786d` TenantContext extension | 4 | 8 | 18 |
| `e8a7a19` resolveEffectiveUser | 5 | 7 | 22 |
| `c688316` redundancy sweep | 1 | 3 | 6 |
| Commit 5 (this) AGENTS.md + closure | 3 | (TBD) | (TBD) |

**Wave 3 final tally (Sessions 47-53):**
- 7 sessions, 6 migration batches + 1 cleanup session
- 72 routes migrated to `withTenant` (91/91 tenant-scoped, 100%)
- 38 latent cross-tenant defense gaps fixed
- 4 leak classes catalogued + 2 architectural patterns codified
- 12 redundant `ctx`-equivalent DB lookups dropped
- 6 lib helpers refactored to take `tenantId` explicitly
- TenantContext extended from 4 → 6 fields
- `resolveEffectiveUser` migrated from legacy AppSession to TenantContext
- Zero `getSession()` calls remain in migrated routes

**No tsc errors at any commit. Pre-push tsc gate clean for all 5 pushes.
No production behavior changes — every commit is structural enforcement
or DiD hardening.**

**Wave 3 closes the largest defensive sweep in Gunner's history:**
the `withTenant` helper now structurally enforces tenant isolation
across every tenant-scoped API route, and the supporting helpers carry
that enforcement into lib/. The leak class is no longer expressible
in code that passes typecheck.

**Next: Wave 4 — repo scrub + D-044 writeup.**

### Session 52 — Wave 3 Session F of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-29) — **WAVE 3 COMPLETE**

`withTenant` migration, FINAL batch 6 of 6. Twelve routes migrated;
**4 latent defense gaps fixed** across 4 of those routes. Wave 3 closes.

**Pre-scan prediction (with refined heuristic incl. `upsert`):**
- 6 cool / 5 warm / 1 warm-write-only.
- Predicted ~8-12 leak sites using Session E density formula
  `(finds+writes) × 0.5`. Actual: **4** — over-predicted by 2-3×.
- Why over-predicted: `sellers/route.ts` had 8 ops but 0 leaks because
  property is consistently pre-validated in every handler →
  DiD-via-FK propagates cleanly through all PropertySeller compound-key
  operations. The density formula doesn't account for routes with
  disciplined upstream tenant validation.

**Routes migrated (alphabetical, batch 6):**

1. `properties/[propertyId]/sellers/route.ts` — clean despite 8 DB ops.
   Property pre-validated in GET/POST/DELETE → all 5 PropertySeller
   compound-key operations are DiD-via-FK.
2. `properties/[propertyId]/story/route.ts` — **1 leak**: post-generation
   read-back used id-only findUnique (Class 1 variant 4). Plus added
   Class 4 gate — `generatePropertyStory` does internal id-only findUnique.
3. `properties/[propertyId]/team/route.ts` — **1 leak**: upsert on
   compound `propertyId_userId` without propertyId pre-validation
   (Class 3). Fix: added findFirst({propertyId, tenantId}) gate.
4. `properties/market-lookup/route.ts` — clean. Config helper, no DB.
5. `properties/route.ts` — clean. All creates with tenantId. Three
   Class 4 helpers (`splitCombinedAddressIfNeeded`, `enrichProperty`,
   `enrichPropertyWithAI`) are called on JUST-created property.id —
   safe by construction.
6. `properties/search/route.ts` — clean. Read-only, scoped.
7. `sellers/[sellerId]/skip-trace/route.ts` — clean. Class 4 gate
   already in place pre-migration (validates seller before delegating).
8. `tasks/route.ts` — **1 leak**: `task.update({where: {id}})` post-
   creation was id-only (Class 1). Now scoped.
9. `tenants/config/route.ts` — clean. `Tenant.id` IS the tenant
   boundary, so id-only WHERE is structurally safe (same precedent as
   `ghl/calendars`).
10. `tenants/invite/route.ts` — clean. Retained `getSession()` re-fetch
    for `session.name` (used as inviterName in invite email) — queued
    cleanup item #2 (TenantContext extension).
11. `users/[userId]/route.ts` — **1 leak**: `user.update({where: {id}})`
    after pre-validation was id-only (Class 1). Plus 1 redundancy drop:
    collapsed two identical `findFirst({id, tenantId})` calls into one.
12. `workflows/route.ts` — clean. updateMany was already tenant-scoped.

**No new leak class (Class 5) found.** All 4 leaks fit existing taxonomy:
- Class 1 (chained-update): 3 sites (story read-back, tasks update, users update)
- Class 3 (id-only/compound-unique upsert): 1 site (team upsert)

**Coverage delta:**
- `withTenant` routes: 79 → **91** (+12)
- `getSession`-direct routes: 15 → **0** (−12 = empty backlog)
- Documented exceptions: 16 → **19** (+3 — added auth/crm/callback,
  debug/webhooks, stripe/checkout to the canonical exception list;
  these were always non-tenant-session but had been omitted from
  OPERATIONS.md table)
- Total `route.ts` files: 110 (unchanged)

**Wave 3 cumulative (sessions A+B+C+D+E+F, 72 routes — 100% coverage):**
- 38 latent leak sites fixed (5 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 13 + 4)
- 11 redundancy drops (4 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 1)
- 6 sessions × 12 routes = 72 routes migrated. Migration **complete**.

**Final cross-batch leak distribution diagnosis:**
| Batch | Routes | Leaks | Density | Cluster |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 12 | 5 | 0.42 | Calls cluster (CRUD) |
| 2 | 12 | 0 | 0.00 | Cool (admin/auth-adjacent) |
| 3 | 12 | 16 | 1.33 | AI-assistant + CRUD (very hot) |
| 4 | 12 | 0 | 0.00 | GHL passthrough + read-only |
| 5 | 12 | 13 | 1.08 | properties/[propertyId]/* (hot) |
| 6 | 12 | 4 | 0.33 | Mixed (densely-DiD'd / Tenant-self ops) |
| **Total** | **72** | **38** | 0.53 | Bell curve confirmed |

**Final heuristic accuracy across 6 batches:**
- Hot/cool classification: 6-for-6. Every batch's pre-scan correctly
  identified the routes with shape-warmth.
- Leak count prediction: variable. Density formula
  `(finds+writes) × 0.5` works as a rough upper bound but
  over-predicts when routes have disciplined upstream validation
  (batch 6 sellers/route.ts) and under-predicts when routes have
  multiple find-then-write sites in a single handler (batch 5 outreach).

**Leak class taxonomy (4 classes, codified in AGENTS.md):**
- Class 1 (chained-update): findFirst({id, tenantId}) → update({id}).
  ~22 sites across Wave 3. Most common.
- Class 2 (JS-side tenant comparison): findUnique({id}) + JS guard
  `record.tenantId !== ctx.tenantId`. ~6 sites.
- Class 3 (id-only / compound-unique upsert): upsert without tenant
  validation. ~3 sites. Discovered in Session E.
- Class 4 (helper-delegate id-only): route delegates to lib helper that
  does id-only lookup internally. ~2 sites. Discovered in Session E.

**End-of-Wave-3 cleanup queue (Session 53 — DO NOT do in this session):**
1. Refactor `resolveEffectiveUser` to accept `TenantContext` instead of
   legacy `AppSession` (currently duck-typed).
2. Extend `TenantContext` to include `userName` + `userEmail`. Drops the
   3 `getSession()` re-fetch sites (`ai/coach`, `bugs/route.ts`,
   `tenants/invite`).
3. `ctx.userRole` redundancy sweep across migrated routes (most batches
   already cleaned, but a final pass before declaring Wave 3 closed).
4. Helper signature audit for opaque-id helpers — fix tenant scoping
   inside `generatePropertyStory`, `skipTraceSeller`,
   `splitCombinedAddressIfNeeded`, `enrichProperty`,
   `enrichPropertyWithAI`, `computePropertyMetrics` themselves so route
   gates aren't load-bearing.

**Files changed:**
- 12 route files (in `app/api/properties/`, `app/api/sellers/`,
  `app/api/tasks/`, `app/api/tenants/`, `app/api/users/`,
  `app/api/workflows/`).
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 52, this entry, Wave 3 close.
- `OPERATIONS.md` — API surface table updated to final state
  (91/0/19), framing rewritten (no longer "ongoing tech-debt"),
  exception table extended from 16 → 19.

**No tsc errors. No production behavior changes.** Pre-push tsc gate clean.

**Wave 3 closes the largest defensive sweep in Gunner's history:**
72 routes migrated, 38 latent cross-tenant leaks fixed, 4 leak classes
catalogued, 6/6 batches landed, structural enforcement now mandatory
for all tenant-scoped routes. The `withTenant` helper makes the leak
class structurally impossible to ship.

### Session 51 — Wave 3 Session E of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-29)

`withTenant` migration, batch 5 of 6. Twelve routes migrated; **13 latent
defense gaps fixed** across 6 of those routes. The properties/[propertyId]/*
cluster lived up to its hot-zone reputation: `outreach` (4 leaks), `buyers`
(3 leaks), `research` (2), `blast` (2), `buyer-stage` (1), `metrics` (1).

**Pre-scan prediction (run for first time as a structural pre-flight):**
- 7 cool / 5 warm by find+write co-presence heuristic.
- Predicted ~4-6 leak sites total. Actual: **13** — 2-3× the prediction.
- Heuristic correctly identified WHICH routes were warm (5/5 hits) but
  underestimated leak DENSITY per warm route. Average 2.4 leaks per
  warm-with-leak route, vs assumed ~1.

**Two new heuristic refinements discovered:**

1. **`upsert` was missing from the pre-scan write-pattern grep.**
   `(update|delete|updateMany|deleteMany)` doesn't match `upsert` (no
   substring overlap with `update`). `buyer-stage` was misclassified
   cool but contained a real cross-tenant-write vector (compound unique
   `propertyId_buyerId` upsert without tenant validation). For batch 6,
   include `upsert` in the write-pattern grep.

2. **Helper-delegate variant — pre-scan can't see lib/ code.**
   `metrics/route.ts` calls `computePropertyMetrics(propertyId)` in
   `lib/computed-metrics.ts`, which does an id-only `findUnique` and
   then trusts the row's tenantId for downstream scoping. This is a real
   cross-tenant read leak invisible to a route-only pre-scan. Rule for
   batch 6: when a route delegates to a lib helper that takes an opaque
   id without explicit tenantId, add a route-level
   `findFirst({ id, tenantId })` validation gate first.

**Routes migrated (alphabetical, batch 5):**

1. `lead-sources/route.ts` — clean. POST upserts on compound key
   `tenantId_source_month_year` (tenantId in unique key = structurally safe).
2. `markets/route.ts` — clean. DELETE uses canonical `delete({ id, tenantId })`.
3. `milestones/route.ts` — clean. POST has `propertyTeamMember.upsert` on
   compound `propertyId_userId` without tenantId in WHERE — DiD-via-FK
   because propertyId is tenant-validated immediately above; noted in code.
4. `notifications/route.ts` — clean. Read-only.
5. `properties/[propertyId]/blast/route.ts` — **2 leaks**:
   - Class 2: approval-gate verification used `auditLog.findUnique({ id })`
     + JS-side `gate.tenantId !== tenantId` comparison. Replaced with
     `findFirst({ id, tenantId, userId, resourceId })`.
   - Class 1: `dealBlast.update({ where: { id } })` post-send was
     id-only. Now scoped with `tenantId`.
6. `properties/[propertyId]/buyer-stage/route.ts` — **1 leak**: upsert
   on compound unique `propertyId_buyerId` without tenant validation.
   Fix: validate property belongs to ctx.tenantId first via findFirst.
   This was the route the pre-scan misclassified cool.
7. `properties/[propertyId]/buyers/route.ts` — **3 leaks** (all in POST
   manual-add flow):
   - `property.findUnique({ id })` for manualBuyerIds read — id-only.
   - `property.update({ id })` for manualBuyerIds write — id-only.
   - `buyer.upsert({ where: { id: \`ghl_${contactId}\` } })` — id-only.
     Replaced with findFirst → conditional create-or-update with
     id+tenantId in WHERE.
8. `properties/[propertyId]/messages/route.ts` — clean. Already DiD-clean
   pre-migration.
9. `properties/[propertyId]/metrics/route.ts` — **1 leak (helper-delegate
   variant)**: route delegated to `computePropertyMetrics(propertyId)`
   without first validating property belongs to caller. Helper does
   id-only findUnique. Fix: route-level `findFirst({ id, tenantId })`
   gate before delegate call.
10. `properties/[propertyId]/outreach/route.ts` — **4 leaks** (densest
    of the batch):
    - `syncOfferFields` helper: `outreachLog.findMany` without tenantId.
    - `syncOfferFields` helper: `property.findUnique({ id })` (variant 4
      read-then-merge — read could leak another tenant's row).
    - `syncOfferFields` helper: `property.update({ id })` (Class 1).
    - POST: `outreachLog.update({ where: { id: body.logId } })` — id-only.
      Now `updateMany({ id, tenantId, propertyId })`.
    Helper signature changed: `tenantId` is now required (was optional).
11. `properties/[propertyId]/re-enrich/route.ts` — clean. Already
    DiD-clean.
12. `properties/[propertyId]/research/route.ts` — **2 leaks**:
    - `property.findUnique({ id })` for read-merge of zillowData (variant 4).
    - `property.update({ id })` for zillowData write (Class 1).

**Coverage delta:**
- `withTenant` routes: 67 → **79** (+12)
- `getSession`-direct routes: 27 → **15** (−12)
- Documented exceptions: 16 (unchanged)
- Total `route.ts` files: 110 (unchanged)

**Wave 3 cumulative (sessions A+B+C+D+E, 60 routes):**
- 34 latent leak sites fixed (5 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 13)
- 10 redundancy drops (4 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 0)
- 5 sessions × 12 routes = 60 routes complete; **1 batch remaining (~12 routes)**.

**Cross-batch leak distribution diagnosis updated:**
| Batch | Routes | Leaks | Density | Cluster |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 12 | 5 | 0.42 | Calls cluster (CRUD) |
| 2 | 12 | 0 | 0.00 | Cool (admin/auth-adjacent) |
| 3 | 12 | 16 | 1.33 | AI-assistant + CRUD (very hot) |
| 4 | 12 | 0 | 0.00 | GHL passthrough + read-only |
| 5 | 12 | 13 | 1.08 | properties/[propertyId]/* (hot) |
| **Total** | **60** | **34** | 0.57 | Bell curve confirmed |

The ~1+ leak/route density in batches 3 and 5 reflects routes with
multiple find-then-write sites per file. Single-file leak counts of
3-7 are common in property-CRUD and AI-tool-dispatch shapes.

**Files changed:**
- 12 route files (in `app/api/lead-sources/`, `app/api/markets/`,
  `app/api/milestones/`, `app/api/notifications/`,
  `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/{blast,buyer-stage,buyers,messages,metrics,outreach,re-enrich,research}/`).
- `AGENTS.md` Route Conventions — extended with two new variants
  (id-only upsert / compound-unique upsert + helper-delegate id-only).
  Plus the upsert-in-pre-scan-grep heuristic refinement.
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 51, this entry, coverage stats.
- `OPERATIONS.md` — API surface table updated (67→79 / 27→15).

**No tsc errors. No production behavior changes** — every leak fix is
defensive against scenarios that don't currently occur in production
data. Pre-push tsc gate clean.

### Session 50 — Wave 3 Session D of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-29)

`withTenant` migration, batch 4 of 6. Twelve routes migrated; **0 latent
defense gaps fixed**. Cool-zone prediction was correct: this batch was the
GHL-passthrough cluster (7 routes under `app/api/ghl/`) plus simple
list/create CRUD (`buyers/route.ts`, `call-rubrics/route.ts`,
`buyers/sync`), one read-only ledger query (`calls/ledger`), and one
already-defense-in-depth route (`kpi-entries`). No find-then-update shape
in any of the 12 routes — the structural diagnosis from Session C held
exactly: "routes that pass through to GHL or do read-only work are cool."

**Routes migrated (alphabetical, batch 4):**

1. `buyers/route.ts` — clean migration. GET list + POST create, no find-then-update.
2. `buyers/sync/route.ts` — clean migration. POST passthrough to GHL + lib helper.
3. `call-rubrics/route.ts` — clean migration. POST `updateMany` was already tenant-scoped.
4. `calls/ledger/route.ts` — clean migration. `resolveEffectiveUser` is duck-typed on `{userId, tenantId}` — passed `ctx` directly, no `getSession()` re-fetch tax (this route doesn't need `userName/userEmail`).
5. `ghl/actions/route.ts` — clean migration. POST → GHL passthrough + auditLog create.
6. `ghl/calendars/route.ts` — clean migration. `tenant.findUnique({ id: ctx.tenantId })` is correct — `Tenant.id` IS the tenant boundary.
7. `ghl/contacts/route.ts` — clean migration. GET → GHL search passthrough.
8. `ghl/phone-numbers/route.ts` — clean migration. GET → GHL passthrough.
9. `ghl/pipelines/route.ts` — clean migration. GET → GHL passthrough.
10. `ghl/reregister-webhook/route.ts` — clean migration. POST → lib helper.
11. `ghl/users/route.ts` — clean migration. GET → GHL + fire-and-forget lib sync.
12. `kpi-entries/route.ts` — clean migration. POST already had defense-in-depth on the property lookup; DELETE already used `deleteMany` with tenantId.

**No new leak-class variants found.** Variants 1-4 from Sessions A+C are
sufficient for this batch's shape coverage — there were no find-then-update
sites to scrutinize. AGENTS.md unchanged.

**No redundancy drops.** None of the 12 routes had the "re-fetch user role"
anti-pattern (admin gating was already done via `hasPermission(role, …)`
on the session role field, not via `db.user.findUnique`). All 6 redundancy
drops in this Wave's tally came from batches 1-3.

**Coverage delta:**
- `withTenant` routes: 55 → **67** (+12)
- `getSession`-direct routes: 39 → **27** (−12)
- Documented exceptions: 16 (unchanged)
- Total `route.ts` files: 110 (unchanged)

**Wave 3 cumulative (sessions A+B+C+D, 48 routes):**
- 21 latent leak sites fixed (5 in batch 1, 0 in batch 2, 16 in batch 3, 0 in batch 4)
- 10 redundancy drops (4 in batch 1, 0 in batch 2, 6 in batch 3, 0 in batch 4)
- ~4 sessions × 12 routes = 48 routes complete; **2 batches remaining (~24 routes)**.

**Cross-batch leak distribution diagnosis confirmed:**
Batches 1+3 hit CRUD/AI clusters (21 leaks combined); batches 2+4 were
GHL/read-only passthroughs (0 leaks combined). Bell curve confirmed —
hot/cool prediction now reliable based on route shape (find-then-update
present = hot; GHL passthrough or read-only = cool). Predictive accuracy
this batch: **12/12 routes correctly classified as cool, 0/0 leaks predicted
vs found**.

**Files changed:**
- 12 route files (in `app/api/buyers/`, `app/api/call-rubrics/`,
  `app/api/calls/ledger/`, `app/api/ghl/` (7 routes), `app/api/kpi-entries/`).
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 50, this entry, coverage stats.
- `OPERATIONS.md` — API surface table updated (55→67 / 39→27).

**Queued cleanup (end of Wave 3, after batch 6):**
- Extend `TenantContext` to include `userName` + `userEmail`; drop the 3
  `getSession()` re-fetch sites (`ai/coach`, `bugs/route.ts`, the
  `resolveEffectiveUser` callers in `dayhub/*` if they need name).
- Refactor `resolveEffectiveUser` to accept `TenantContext` instead of
  legacy `AppSession` (current duck-typing works but is implicit).

**No tsc errors. No production behavior changes** — all 12 routes are
behaviorally identical to before the migration (structural enforcement
only, no semantic changes). Pre-push tsc gate clean.

### Session 49 — Wave 3 Session C of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-28)

`withTenant` migration, batch 3 of 6. Twelve routes migrated; **16 latent
defense gaps fixed** across 6 of those routes. Hot-zone prediction was
correct: the AI assistant cluster (`ai/assistant/execute`) and CRUD-shape
routes (`bugs/[id]`, `buyers/[buyerId]`, `admin/user-profiles`,
`admin/load-playbook`) accounted for all 16 fixes. Cool routes
(`ai/assistant/session`, `ai/coach`, `ai/outreach-action`,
`admin/knowledge`, `bugs/route.ts`) were leak-free as expected.

**Routes migrated (alphabetical, batch 3):**

1. `admin/knowledge/route.ts` — clean migration, 1 ctx.userRole redundancy drop
2. `admin/load-playbook/route.ts` — **1 leak** (`knowledgeDocument.update` by id-only) + 1 redundancy drop
3. `admin/user-profiles/route.ts` — **1 leak** (`userProfile.update` by id-only after tenant-scoped findFirst) + 2 redundancy drops
4. `ai/assistant/execute/route.ts` — **7 leaks across the 13-tool dispatch table**:
   - `log_offer`: `Property.update` by id only
   - `add_internal_note`: id-only `Property.findUnique` → re-merge → tenant-scoped update (read could leak)
   - `update_deal_intel`: same pattern as add_internal_note
   - `set_property_markets`: `Property.update` by id only inside the markets loop
   - `move_buyer_in_pipeline`: `PropertyBuyerStage.updateMany({ buyerId })` without tenantId — `PropertyBuyerStage` has its own tenantId column
   - `update_buyer`: `Buyer.update` by id only after tenant-scoped findFirst
   - `update_user_role`: `User.update` by id only after tenant-scoped findFirst
   - `remove_team_member`: id+userId compound delete on `PropertyTeamMember` without tenantId — switched to `deleteMany` to add tenantId
5. `ai/assistant/route.ts` — clean migration, 1 redundancy drop (used `ctx.userRole` instead of re-fetching `user.role`)
6. `ai/assistant/session/route.ts` — clean migration, 1 redundancy drop
7. `ai/coach/route.ts` — clean migration, retained `getSession()` re-fetch for `userName` (ctx doesn't expose name; queued for end-of-Wave-3 ctx extension)
8. `ai/outreach-action/route.ts` — clean migration
9. `blasts/route.ts` — **1 leak** (`dealBlast.update` by id-only after tenant-scoped findFirst)
10. `bugs/[id]/route.ts` — **5 leak sites** across GET/PATCH/DELETE: three `findUnique({ id })` + JS-side `tenantId !==` comparison anti-pattern; one id-only `update`; one id-only `delete` (switched to `deleteMany`). Plus 1 redundancy drop (the `requireAdmin` helper).
11. `bugs/route.ts` — clean migration, 1 redundancy drop. Retains `getSession()` re-fetch for reporter name/email.
12. `buyers/[buyerId]/route.ts` — **1 leak** (`Buyer.update` by id-only after tenant-scoped findFirst). Predicted hot zone confirmed.

**New leak-class variants codified in AGENTS.md:**

- `findUnique({ where: { id } })` + `bug.tenantId !== ctx.tenantId` JS comparison.
  The DB query is unscoped; the JS guard is the only thing keeping the row
  from leaking. Replaced with `findFirst({ where: { id, tenantId } })`.
- `delete({ where: { compoundUniqueKey } })` without tenantId. Prisma `delete`
  on a unique key doesn't accept extra-key fields. Fix: `deleteMany({ id, tenantId })`.

**ctx.userRole canonical pattern codified.** Six routes had a redundant
`db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: session.userId }, select: { role: true } })`
to gate admin endpoints. `ctx.userRole` is already populated from the JWT
session by `withTenant`. Drops a DB roundtrip per request and removes the
"look up the same user twice" pattern.

**Coverage delta:**
- `withTenant` routes: 43 → **55** (+12)
- `getSession`-direct routes: 51 → **39** (−12)
- Documented exceptions: 16 (unchanged)
- Total `route.ts` files: 110 (unchanged)

**Wave 3 cumulative (sessions A+B+C, 36 routes):**
- 21 latent leak sites fixed (5 in batch 1, 0 in batch 2, 16 in batch 3)
- 10 redundancy drops (4 in batch 1, 0 in batch 2, 6 in batch 3)
- ~3 sessions × 12 routes = 36 routes complete; **3 batches remaining (~36 routes)**.

**Cross-batch leak distribution diagnosis:**
Batch 1 hit the calls cluster (5 leaks); batch 2 was cool (0 leaks);
batch 3 hit the AI-assistant + CRUD cluster (16 leaks). The structural
explanation: routes that follow a "find a record, then mutate that record"
shape are leak hot zones; routes that pass through to GHL or do read-only
work are cool. Bell curve confirmed — batches 4-6 will likely be a mix.

**Files changed:**
- 12 route files (in `app/api/admin/`, `app/api/ai/`, `app/api/blasts/`,
  `app/api/bugs/`, `app/api/buyers/[buyerId]/`).
- `AGENTS.md` Route Conventions — extended with two new leak-class
  variants (id-only findUnique + JS comparison; id-only delete on compound
  unique). Plus the new "Don't re-fetch user role — `ctx.userRole` is canonical"
  sub-section.
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 49, this entry, coverage stats.
- `OPERATIONS.md` — API surface table updated (43→55 / 51→39).

**No tsc errors. No production behavior changes** — every leak fix is
defensive against scenarios that don't currently occur. Pre-push tsc gate
clean.

### Session 48 — Wave 3 Session B of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-28)

`withTenant` migration, batch 2 of 6. Twelve routes migrated. **Zero
latent defense gaps** found — the lower extreme that triggered the
"STOP AND REPORT" check. Diagnosis (also captured below): structural,
not a methodology gap. Batch 2's 12 routes are dominated by GHL
pass-throughs (route reads tenant config, hands off to GHL API, writes
an audit log only — no DB find-then-update on tenant-scoped tables) and
admin gates that already had `getSession()`-direct tenant scoping
elsewhere. The "find a record then mutate that record" shape — the
hot zone for the chained-update leak class — simply isn't present in
this batch.

**Routes migrated:**

1. `app/api/[tenant]/dayhub/tasks/route.ts` (GET + POST)
2. `app/api/[tenant]/dayhub/team-numbers/route.ts` (GET)
3. `app/api/[tenant]/ghl/appointments/route.ts` (GET + POST)
4. `app/api/[tenant]/ghl/notes/route.ts` (POST)
5. `app/api/[tenant]/ghl/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts` (PATCH)
6. `app/api/[tenant]/ghl/workflows/[workflowId]/route.ts` (POST)
7. `app/api/[tenant]/ghl/workflows/route.ts` (GET)
8. `app/api/[tenant]/tasks/[contactId]/details/route.ts` (GET)
9. `app/api/admin/ai-logs/[id]/route.ts` (GET)
10. `app/api/admin/ai-logs/route.ts` (GET)
11. `app/api/admin/embed-knowledge/route.ts` (POST)
12. `app/api/admin/generate-profiles/route.ts` (POST)

**Bonus:** four admin routes (`ai-logs/[id]`, `ai-logs`, `embed-knowledge`,
`generate-profiles`) had a redundant `db.user.findUnique({ where: { id:
session.userId }, select: { role: true } })` to gate admin endpoints.
After migration, `ctx.userRole` is canonical — dropped four DB roundtrips.
Pattern formalized as a Wave 3 convention in batch 3's AGENTS.md update.

**Coverage delta:**
- `withTenant` routes: 31 → **43** (+12)
- `getSession`-direct routes: 63 → **51** (−12)
- Documented exceptions: 16 (unchanged)
- Total `route.ts` files: 110 (unchanged)

**Leak find rate diagnosis (batch 1: 5/12, batch 2: 0/12):** batch 1
hit `app/api/[tenant]/calls/[id]/*` and `calls/bulk-regrade` — every leak
followed the same shape (tenant-scoped find followed by id-only write back).
That's a hot zone for the chained-update class. Batch 2's clusters
(`dayhub/*`, `ghl/*`, `tasks/[contactId]/details`, `admin/*`) are
GHL-pass-through or read-only — no shape match. **This is consistent with
the prompt's hypothesis that "either extreme is a signal worth diagnosing."**
Not a methodology bug. Future batches that touch
`app/api/properties/[propertyId]/*` and `app/api/buyers/*` are predicted
to surface chained-update leaks again (same find-then-update shape).

**No tsc errors. No production behavior changes.**

### Session 47 — Wave 3 Session A of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-28)

`withTenant` migration, batch 1 of 6. Twelve routes flipped from
`getSession()` direct + manual `tenantId` tracking to the `withTenant`
wrapper that makes "forget to scope by tenant" structurally impossible.

**Routes migrated (alphabetical, all under `app/api/[tenant]/*`):**

1. `calls/[id]/ai-edit/route.ts`
2. `calls/[id]/deal-intel/route.ts` — **leak caught**
3. `calls/[id]/generate-next-steps/route.ts` — **leak caught (×2)**
4. `calls/[id]/property-suggestions/route.ts`
5. `calls/[id]/reprocess/route.ts` — **leak caught**
6. `calls/bulk-regrade/route.ts` — **leak caught**
7. `calls/upload/route.ts` — **leak caught (×3 structural)**
8. `dayhub/appointments/route.ts`
9. `dayhub/contact-activity/route.ts`
10. `dayhub/inbox/route.ts`
11. `dayhub/kpis/route.ts`
12. `dayhub/messages/route.ts`

**Latent cross-tenant defense gaps caught + fixed (8 sites across 5 routes):**

- **deal-intel**: `Property.findUnique({ where: { id: call.propertyId } })`
  + `Property.update({ where: { id: call.propertyId } })` — both id-only.
  `call.propertyId` is a foreign key; if it ever pointed at a different-tenant
  property (data corruption upstream), this would leak/overwrite. Both now
  scoped by `tenantId: ctx.tenantId`.
- **generate-next-steps**: two trailing `Call.update({ where: { id: params.id } })`
  calls — id-only after a tenant-scoped findFirst. Now both scoped on update.
- **reprocess**: same id-only `Call.update` pattern. Scoped.
- **bulk-regrade**: `Call.updateMany({ where: { id: { in: callIds } } })` — the
  id list came from a tenant-scoped findMany (so the IDs were all this-tenant),
  but the updateMany didn't re-enforce. Future refactor that broke the upstream
  filter would silently leak. Now scoped.
- **upload**: three `Call.update({ where: { id: callId } })` calls on the
  just-created row. callId came from same-handler `create` so no active leak,
  but defense-in-depth — id-only writes are the wrong pattern regardless.
  All three now scoped.

None of these are known active leaks. They are **structural defense gaps**:
the kind of code that is correct today but one upstream-refactor away from
silently crossing the boundary. Wave 1's lesson + this batch reinforces the
AGENTS.md convention: every db write WHERE needs `tenantId`, even when the
upstream find was already scoped.

**Coverage delta:**
- `withTenant` routes: 19 → **31** (+12)
- `getSession`-direct routes: 75 → **63** (−12)
- Documented exceptions (auth/cron/webhooks/health/diagnostics/vieira/stripe): 16 (unchanged)
- Total `route.ts` files: 110 (unchanged)

**Remaining migration backlog: ~63 routes across batches 2-6.**

**Files changed:**

- 12 route files (in `app/api/[tenant]/calls/...` and `app/api/[tenant]/dayhub/...`).
- `AGENTS.md` Route Conventions — new sub-section "Every db.* WHERE needs
  tenant scope — including chained updates" codifies the leak-class found
  in this batch (find-scoped + update-unscoped pattern). Lists the five
  routes as concrete examples for future agents.
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 47, this entry, coverage stats.

**No tsc errors. No production behavior changes** — every leak fix is
defensive against scenarios that don't currently occur. Pre-push tsc gate
clean. Verification path: spot-check a route via `/api/diagnostics/dial-counts`
or by sending a request with mismatched tenantId param — should now hit a
401 from `withTenant` rather than potentially executing.

### Session 46 — Wave 2 of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-28)

Two display-correctness bugs on the dial-count surface, bundled because both
touched the same aggregation logic. Closed PROGRESS P4 #3 + #4 (the items the
user mapped to Wave-2 P1/P2 — see scope-correction note below).

**Part A — Wave-2 P1: canonical Day Hub "Calls Made" never aggregated for admins.**

`app/(tenant)/[tenant]/day-hub/page.tsx:153` always filtered the calls count
by `assignedToId: userId` regardless of role. The `isAdmin` branch above it
(line 39) only multiplied **goals** by headcount — the actual numerator was
single-user. Result: an admin/owner viewing Day Hub saw their own dials over
a goal scaled to the whole team.

The query also used `createdAt` while `/calls` page ordering, the `/api/[tenant]/dayhub/kpis`
backend, and `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/health/page.tsx` all use `calledAt`.
Webhook lag at midnight boundaries put boundary calls in the wrong day,
pushing the rendered count further out of sync.

**Part B — Wave-2 P2: three surfaces, three queries.**

- `/day-hub/` canonical → `createdAt` + always-single-user (BUG, fixed above).
- `/api/[tenant]/dayhub/kpis` (backs legacy `/tasks/` Day Hub including the
  admin LM/AM/DISPO role tabs) → `calledAt` + role-aware via `userIds=` query
  param. Logic was correct.
- `/calls` page → `calledAt` ordering, JS-side date filter (default 7d).

The fix: extracted `lib/kpis/dial-counts.ts` as the single source of truth.
Three scopes (`all` | `user` | `users`), `calledAt`-pinned, plus convo
helper (graded ≥45s). Both Day Hub surfaces now go through it. Drift can't
recur on the date field or the aggregation rule because there's only one
place to change.

**Scope-correction note (Wave-1-style audit accuracy):**

The Wave-2 prompt referenced "AUDIT_PLAN P1/P2" — those entries did not
exist. The two items lived in `PROGRESS.md` "P4 — Technical debt" #3 + #4
as one-line tech-debt mentions, never authored as AUDIT_PLAN P-entries.
Per Wave-1 lesson ("AUDIT_PLAN P-entries must be authored from a fresh
codebase grep, not from a single-file finding"), Wave 2 added them
retroactively to AUDIT_PLAN as CLOSED entries with the fresh-grep scope.

The other catch from the fresh grep: the "LM tab" only ever existed on the
**legacy /tasks/ Day Hub** (`app/(tenant)/[tenant]/tasks/day-hub-client.tsx`),
not on the canonical `/day-hub/`. The legacy backend at `/api/[tenant]/dayhub/kpis`
was already correct for that tab. The "227 not aggregating" symptom most
plausibly traced to the **canonical /day-hub/ admin bug**, not to the LM
tab itself. Fix on canonical surface fixes the symptom; refactor on the
legacy surface protects against future drift while it sticks around.

**Files changed:**

- `lib/kpis/dial-counts.ts` — new. Wave 2: 80 lines (today + convo helpers).
  Wave 2 follow-up: added `countDialsInRange(scope, range)` primitive so
  multi-day dashboard windows could route through the same module.
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/day-hub/page.tsx` — calls/convos count via helper.
- `app/api/[tenant]/dayhub/kpis/route.ts` — calls/convos count via helper.
- `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/dashboard/page.tsx` — callsToday/Week/Month via
  helper (added in Wave 2 follow-up commit; closes the third dial-count
  surface that surfaced during the Wave 2 grep).
- `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` §Computed metrics — new entry for `lib/kpis/dial-counts.ts`.
- `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` — P1 + P2 added retroactively (status: PATCH SHIPPED,
  verification pending). D-045 (proposed) added for kpi-snapshot.ts
  timestamp-semantics decision.
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped to Session 46; P4 #3 + #4 + #7 dropped
  (dashboard fix landed before #7 needed its own wave).

**Commits:**

- `98e5e7d` — Wave 2 (Day Hub canonical + legacy backend, helper extracted).
- `525e8b8` — dashboard fix + AUDIT_PLAN status corrections + D-045 +
  PROGRESS verification checklist. Stacked rather than amended so the
  cadence stays honest (Wave 2 closed the user-listed items; the dashboard
  fix is genuine follow-up work).
- `f0c4de9` — Wave-2 verification infrastructure: token-gated
  `/api/diagnostics/dial-counts` endpoint + fix for a host-TZ bug in
  `lib/dates.ts:getCentralDayBounds`. The TZ bug used
  `new Date(noon.toLocaleString(...))` which silently produced wrong
  bounds on any host not running in UTC — production was lucky (Railway
  is UTC) but local dev / scripts / future Railway region changes were
  one config flip from silent KPI drift. Now uses
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat.formatToParts` and is host-TZ-independent
  (verified across UTC, America/Los_Angeles, America/New_York,
  Europe/London, Asia/Tokyo). No tests added — the project has no test
  framework configured (no jest/vitest/etc.); flagging as a separate
  decision the project owes itself.
- `f8e58bb` — middleware fix: `/api/diagnostics` was being intercepted
  by NextAuth middleware and 307-redirected to `/login` before the
  route handler's bearer-token check could fire. Caught at the post-push
  probe of `f0c4de9`. Fix is a one-line addition to `PUBLIC_PATHS`;
  same pattern as `/api/cron`, `/api/webhooks`, `/api/vieira` (all
  self-gating).

**Verification Owed (gated on Railway env)**

The verification infrastructure is shipped (commits `f0c4de9` + `f8e58bb`),
but `DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN` must be set on Railway dashboard env before the
endpoint is callable. Until then it returns 401 to all callers (fail-closed
by design — a missing env var is a no-op, not an open door).

Once `DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN` is set:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN" \
  "[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/diagnostics/dial-counts?tenant=new-again-houses&date=2026-04-27"
```

Expected match against the prior REST-API SQL probe (Session 46 first
verification attempt): `tenantDials=317`, `lmDials=215`. If endpoint
matches → flip P1+P2 to CLOSED and check the boxes below. If it
doesn't → the helper has drift from raw SQL and Wave 2 fix is incomplete.

Original SQL still runnable from Supabase dashboard or any environment
with DB credentials (kept here as redundant verification):

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE assigned_to_id IN
    (SELECT id FROM users WHERE tenant_id=$1 AND role='LEAD_MANAGER'))
    AS lm_dials,
  COUNT(*) AS tenant_dials
FROM calls
WHERE tenant_id = $1
  AND called_at >= (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago')::date
                     AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago'
  AND called_at <  (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago')::date + INTERVAL '1 day'
                     AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago';
```

Three numbers must match (for the same role scope + 2026-04-27 CT, the
date used for the verification window since 2026-04-28 had just rolled
over with no business activity yet):

- [x] DB count (via Supabase REST + service-role): tenant=**317**, LM=**215**
- [x] Day Hub render (via /api/diagnostics/dial-counts helper path): tenantDials=**317**, lmDials=**215**
- [x] Calls page render (same `calledAt` window, < 500 take limit so list = count): **317**

Verified 2026-04-28 via curl against
`/api/diagnostics/dial-counts?tenant=new-again-houses&date=2026-04-27`.
Helper `lib/kpis/dial-counts.ts countDialsInRange` returned identical
counts to the SQL ground truth probe. CDT bounds correctly computed
(`2026-04-27T05:00:00.000Z` → `2026-04-28T04:59:59.999Z`).

Result → P1 + P2 flipped to CLOSED in AUDIT_PLAN.md.

### Session 45 — Wave 1 of v1-finish sprint (2026-04-27)

Two-item bundle on the AI/worker layer. Both items closed in a single commit
because both touch `lib/ai/` + worker infra and both were narrow code surgery
with low risk.

**Part A — Blocker #3: dual grading worker · CLOSED.**

- Removed `[[services]] grading-worker` block (8 lines) from `railway.toml`.
- Deleted `scripts/grading-worker.ts` (now-orphaned standalone entry).
- Kept `scripts/process-recording-jobs.ts` as manual debug surface (also
  reachable via `app/api/cron/process-recording-jobs/route.ts` HTTP wrapper).
- `instrumentation.ts` → `lib/grading-worker.ts` → `lib/grading-processor.ts`
  is now the sole grading path. Atomic claim no longer protecting against a
  second worker — protecting against future re-introduction.
- Post-deploy verification owed within 30 min: confirm Railway `grading-worker`
  service goes away + heartbeat audit rows continue at ~1/min single source.

**Part B — AUDIT_PLAN P3: AI model date-pin standardization · CLOSED.**

- Swept all `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` across **9
  occurrences in 5 files** (5× larger than the AUDIT_PLAN P3 entry suggested):
  `lib/ai/enrich-property.ts`, `app/api/[tenant]/calls/[id]/property-suggestions/route.ts`,
  `app/api/[tenant]/calls/[id]/generate-next-steps/route.ts`,
  `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/blast/route.ts`.
- Post-sweep grep returns ZERO hits for the date-pinned identifier.
- Final inventory: 13 Sonnet 4.6 callers + 4 Opus 4.6 callers, no drift.
- Did NOT touch the Sonnet/Opus role assignment — Wave 1 was strictly a
  date-pin sweep. The current Sonnet (conversation) / Opus (high-stakes
  extraction) split is the stability-first split per D-044 (DECISIONS
  writeup deferred to Wave 4).

**Lessons captured for future audits:**

- The AUDIT_PLAN P3 entry was authored from a single-file finding
  (`lib/ai/enrich-property.ts:57`) — the actual contagion was 5× wider.
  **AUDIT_PLAN entries must be authored from a fresh codebase grep**, not
  from an isolated observation. Updated AUDIT_PLAN P3 closure note codifies
  this.
- The original prompt for Wave 1 stated the rule as "grading → Sonnet,
  coaching → Opus" — exactly inverted from the code's current Opus / Sonnet
  split. Stop-and-report caught the contradiction before any code flipped.
  Future model-policy work should grep before stating the rule.

**Companion doc updates in this commit:**

- `AUDIT_PLAN.md` — Blocker #3 → CLOSED with post-deploy verification queries;
  P3 → CLOSED with corrected scope + lesson note.
- `SYSTEM_MAP.md` §6 — enrich-property table row updated to post-sweep state;
  added rows for the 4 API routes that also call Sonnet 4.6 + audit script
  (Opus 4.6); D-0XX renamed D-044 (driver provided = stability-first), full
  writeup still pending Wave 4.
- `PROGRESS.md` — header bumped Session 44 → 45; Active Blockers updated;
  this entry added.

### Session 44 — Docs reorganization sprint (2026-04-27)

The sprint that was the session. 8 commits, `ea02beb..f1284f3`, replacing
the rotted ARCHITECTURE / MODULES / TECH_STACK / AI-ARCHITECTURE-PLAN /
GUNNER_DAYHUB_CALLS_PROMPT / START_HERE orientation surface with two
living docs (`docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` slow-changing + `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
fast-changing) plus the Rule 8 discipline that keeps them honest.

**Reconnaissance findings caught during the sprint** (the part that
exceeded the cleanup value):

- 70-commit drift between local PROGRESS (Session 38) and remote (Session 43)
  — sprint started with a rebase to absorb Sessions 39-43.
- **Dual grading worker contradiction** — `instrumentation.ts` in-process
  AND legacy `[[services]] grading-worker` both running. Atomic claim
  prevents double-grading. Logged as **Blocker #3** in AUDIT_PLAN.
- AGENTS.md "Background Worker Conventions" stale post-Session-42 in-process
  move. Rewritten in Commit #1.
- AI model state hybrid — Opus 4.7-era prompt config (32k tokens, extended
  thinking, 50 prior calls) intentionally retained even though model strings
  reverted to Opus 4.6 in `598f852`. Logged as **PENDING D-0XX** in AUDIT_PLAN.
- `assign_contact_to_user` bypasses propose-edit-confirm UI flow that gates
  the other 12 action types. Logged as **P5** in AUDIT_PLAN.
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` date-pinned snapshot in `lib/ai/enrich-property.ts`
  drifted from the `claude-sonnet-4-6` baseline. Logged as **P3** in AUDIT_PLAN.
- `/{tenant}/tasks/` legacy page kept around because Chris bookmarked it.
  Logged as **P4** in AUDIT_PLAN.
- 6 of 7 crons missing `cron.<name>.started/finished` heartbeat audit row
  pattern (only `process_recording_jobs` has it). Captured in OPERATIONS
  heartbeat coverage table; tracked as Bug #23.
- `poll-calls` "heartbeat" claim was a per-tenant timestamp lock (Session 35
  pgbouncer fix), not an audit-row heartbeat — doc-review catch in OPERATIONS §1.
- 3 stale doc references (CLAUDE.md Rule 8 body, AGENTS.md x2, lib/ai/scoring.ts:30)
  preemptively repointed in Commit #4 so Commit #5 archive could be a clean
  `git mv` with a zero-hit gate grep.
- Local env was stale post-rebase — false tsc errors until `npx prisma generate
  && npm install`. Codified as a hygiene ritual in OPERATIONS.

**Commits (chronological):**

- `077ef41` **#0** — CLAUDE.md Rule 8 (Living Map Discipline) + 6th end-of-session checklist item.
- `6f37ce8` **#1** — AGENTS Background Worker Conventions rewrite (instrumentation.ts as primary) + PROGRESS catch-up to Session 43 + AUDIT_PLAN Blocker #3 + grading.ts:204 stale Opus 4.7 comment fix. 5 files.
- `94f526b` **#2** — `docs/SYSTEM_MAP.md` (506 lines, slow-changing canonical) + AUDIT_PLAN P5.
- `dc53112` **#3** — `docs/OPERATIONS.md` (421 lines, fast-changing operational state — crons, pages, API surface 109/19/75/15, scripts, blockers, schema log, worker observability with admin tenant-spanning queries, hygiene rituals, incident notes).
- `39c528e` **#4** — README rewrite (164 → 29 lines, agent-focused) + CLAUDE/AGENTS pointer updates + lib/ai/scoring.ts comment update.
- `089ed61` **#5** — `git mv` 6 superseded docs into `docs/archive/`. Pre-archive gate grep returned zero hits.
- `a46bd46` **#6** — delete orphan `functions/poll-calls.js`.
- `f1284f3` **#7** — `git mv API_FIELD_INVENTORY.md docs/` + strip stale "(after sprint Commit #7)" pointers.
- (this commit) **#8** — sprint wrap-up: PROGRESS header → COMPLETE, Session 44 entry, Next Session rewrite, OPERATIONS baseline anchor bump.

**Conventions added by the sprint** (worth highlighting because future sessions
should follow them):

- Pre-flight `git log --oneline <baseline>..HEAD` before each push — surfaced
  the 70-commit drift on Commit #0 push attempt; would have caught silent
  drift any time after.
- Pre-archive gate grep — strict zero-hit requirement for active surfaces
  before `git mv`-ing a doc.
- Doc-only commits paste back diff before pushing; code-touching commits
  must pass `npx tsc --noEmit` (enforced by pre-push hook).
- Trailer dropped: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context)` → no trailer,
  starting Commit #2.

### Session 43 — Bug-report v2 + grading empty-shell fix (2026-04-26)

Bullet-level reconstruction from git log. No detailed session notes existed — this is the catch-up.

- `4840c52` fix(grading): stop creating empty-shell FAILED + PENDING calls — addresses
  the structural bug behind PROGRESS bug #22 at the create site, not just the cleanup
  pass. New shells should not enter the database.
- `8e13fb3` feat(bugs): attach screenshot to bug-report button — adds base64 image data
  URL field to BugReport (migration `20260427000000_add_bug_screenshot`). Cap is
  ~7.5MB at the API boundary (`MAX_SCREENSHOT_BYTES` in `app/api/bugs/route.ts`).

### Session 42 — Enrichment refinement + AI logs UI + bug-report v1 (2026-04-24)

Bullet-level reconstruction from git log.

- `0f6bd2b` refactor(enrichment): PropertyRadar is primary data source, BatchData
  fills gaps on every lead. Replaces the Session-41 single-vendor-first approach with
  a dual-source merge.
- `8fbdd5f` fix(enrichment): per-vendor isolation + reliable orchestrator invocation.
  Vendor failures no longer take down the whole orchestrator.
- `f452e7f` feat(ai-logs): tabbed UI (Team Chats / AI Work / Problems) with plain-English
  labels at `/{tenant}/ai-logs`. Admin-facing.
- `5c90e24` feat(bugs): persistent bug-report button (`components/ui/floating-bug-button.tsx`)
  + admin review page (`app/(tenant)/[tenant]/bugs/`). Schema migration
  `20260424000000_add_bug_reports`.

### Session 41 — Multi-vendor enrichment pipeline (2026-04-23)

Bullet-level reconstruction from git log. The big build day for the enrichment overhaul.
Net result: ~doubled property field coverage; -92% projected BatchData spend.

- `f2b7628` feat(enrichment): multi-vendor property + seller pipeline (initial
  orchestrator across PropertyRadar, BatchData, RentCast, RealEstateAPI, CourtListener,
  Google, Supabase storage in `lib/enrichment/`).
- `32771fd` fix(courtlistener): scope by state + exact-name filter.
- `f3855c0` feat(ui): surface distress/MLS/court data across inventory + seller UIs.
- `dde3176` fix(enrichment): `buildDenormUpdate` now writes beds/baths/sqft + tax basics
  (was missing from initial build).
- `933d28b` feat(enrichment): PropertyRadar detail + `/persons` fetch (~10 fields/property).
- `2c88541` feat(enrichment): capture all vendor fields — nearly doubles property coverage.
- `53b83c4` feat(inventory): comprehensive vendor intel in property detail UI.
- `3b9ba70` fix(enrichment): manual create + re-enrich routes now fire vendor orchestrator
  (previously skipped the orchestrator path).
- `29b2d15` fix(courtlistener): upgrade V3 → V4 + leads-today audit scripts
  (`scripts/check-todays-leads.ts`, `check-today-leads.ts`).
- `fada00b` feat(enrichment): gate BatchData behind PropertyRadar motivation signals
  (projected -92% BatchData spend).

### Session 39-40 — API field inventory + schema wave 1 + inventory redesign (2026-04-22 to 2026-04-23)

> Detailed entry archived in `docs/SESSION_ARCHIVE.md`. Summary kept here for cross-reference:

- `API_FIELD_INVENTORY.md` authored — vendor-by-vendor field comparison
  (PropertyRadar, RealEstateAPI, RentCast, BatchData) informing Wave 1 schema design.
- Schema Wave 1 — 80+ columns across Property, PropertySeller, PropertyBuyer, Call.
- Inventory UI redesign — Property Story generator, cash-hero matrix, persistent
  cross-tab side panel.
- Nightly aggregates cron (`compute-aggregates`) — seller portfolio + voice analytics
  + buyer funnel.
- Self-driving grading worker via `instrumentation.ts` (commit `6cb5c0a`) +
  `lib/grading-worker.ts` + `lib/grading-processor.ts` — primary grading loop
  moved in-process. Legacy `[[services]] grading-worker` not removed (Blocker #3).
- AI model churn (Opus 4.7 → Opus 4.6 with 4.7-era prompt config) — see PENDING
  D-0XX in `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md`.

The `2021-04-15` value in `lib/ghl/fetch-recording.ts` and `lib/ai/transcribe.ts` is a separate-and-required value for the recording subsystem (documented inline). No code change needed. | RESOLVED | Closed |
| 16 | DEV_BYPASS_AUTH references hardcoded slugs | LOW | Clean up before tenant #2 |
| 17 | callResult `no_answer` never rewritten to `short_call` when cron routes <45s call to SKIPPED. Surfaced 4× in Session 37 verifier Pass B. | MEDIUM | Either fix in cron processor or update spec to accept both for short calls |
| 18 | 2487 `calls` rows have `source IS NULL` (oldest 2026-03-21, newest 2026-04-18, **0 in last 24h**). Likely from `scripts/recover-stuck-calls.ts` not setting source. | LOW | One-time `UPDATE` to backfill `source='recovery'`; grep `db.call.create` to add `source` to all script callsites |
| 19 | One legacy row `cmo4o88zn0raqn5nzaboykobe` (ghlCallId `VyCnm5DBNBVFfipIo0FR`) — non-wf_ id GHL doesn't recognize, source/contactId/duration all null. | LOW | Single instance, no production impact. Origin worth understanding (covered by #18 backfill) |
| 20 | Deal intel parser has a markdown-fence regression — `` ```json `` not stripped. Session 34 `stripJsonFences()` fix covers grading only. Calls still grade cleanly; deal intel returns 0 proposed changes. Observed 6× across Session 38 manual drains. | MEDIUM | Extract stripJsonFences into a shared util and use in lib/ai/extract-deal-intel.ts |
| 21 | Sentiment/sellerMotivation type coercion incomplete — Claude occasionally returns strings ("positive", full prose paragraphs) where Prisma expects Float. Prior fix `79e916e` missed some shapes. Surfaced 4× in the 04:14-04:28 UTC window today. | MEDIUM | Normalize in `parseGradingResponse()` before the `db.call.update` — string→null mapping for these fields |
| 22 | 24 empty-shell FAILED rows from 2026-04-20 have `ghlContactId=NULL`, `recording_url=NULL`, `duration=NULL`. Pre-existing structural issue — GHL fires call-like webhooks with no payload content. Fix 1 (Session 38 `a77911c`) prevents NEW ones but does not remediate these 24. | LOW | One-time `UPDATE calls SET gradingStatus='SKIPPED' WHERE gradingStatus='FAILED' AND recording_url IS NULL AND tenantId=(…)` to clean up |
| 23 | Railway `[[cron]] process-recording-jobs` would not self-register even after no-op redeploy. Workaround: converted to `[[services]] grading-worker` long-running worker (Session 38). Unknown if poll-calls, daily-audit, daily-kpi-snapshot, weekly-profiles crons are at risk of the same failure. | MEDIUM | Add per-cron heartbeat audit rows (same pattern as `1c8befe`) so a similar silent outage is immediately visible |
| 24 | Body-size gap on `/api/ai/assistant/execute` — `editedInput` is `z.record(z.unknown()).optional()`, no content-length check. Malicious/malformed client could POST multi-MB payloads that bloat audit_logs. | LOW (P2) | Logged in AUDIT_PLAN.md. Follow-up: tighter per-action zod schemas across all endpoints, not piecemeal |
| 25 | `GET /[tenantSlug]/api/calls-review-count` returns 404 on /tasks/ page. Surfaced during Wave 6 V1 verification (2026-04-30). Source: `components/ui/top-nav.tsx:42` — `fetch(\`/${tenantSlug}/api/calls-review-count\`).catch(() => null)`. Path order is wrong (the working call on line 45 is `/api/${tenantSlug}/calls/review-count`). Inline comment on line 43 says "avoid new endpoint" — author pivoted to the existing tenant API but forgot to delete the original fetch. Fire-and-forget with `.catch(() => null)`, so no user-visible breakage; only console noise. | LOW | One-line cleanup: delete line 42 of `components/ui/top-nav.tsx`. Defer to v1.1. Not a security issue. |

All other bugs from sessions 1-32 are resolved.

## Next Session — Blocker #2: run the verification ritual on live UI

Verification infrastructure is now SHIPPED + DEPLOYED (Session 65,
commits `0c6eb89` + `3433c21` + `7ac5ee7`). The diagnostic endpoint
`/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit?tenant=new-again-houses` returns
the per-tool audit-row evidence in one curl. The ritual click-paths
are documented in `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` "Blocker #2 verification ritual".

**What you (Corey) do next session:**
Drive the live UI through the 6 high-stakes Role Assistant tools per
the ritual in AUDIT_PLAN.md. Each tool gets:
- 1 approve trial (verify side effect lands + audit row lands)
- 1 reject trial (verify NO side effect + actionLog row with `wasRejected: true`)

The 6 tools:
1. `send_sms_blast` — ask assistant to SMS-blast priority buyers; approve via two-stage gate at /disposition.
2. `send_email_blast` — same flow, email.
3. `bulk_tag_contacts` — currently a stub (verify proposal flow only).
4. `remove_contact_from_property` — on a property, ask assistant to remove a seller.
5. `remove_team_member` — on a property, ask assistant to remove a team member.
6. `change_property_status` — on a property, ask assistant to flip status.

**What Claude does next session:**
1. Run the diagnostic endpoint pre-ritual to get baseline counts:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIAGNOSTIC_TOKEN" \
     "[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/diagnostics/high-stakes-audit?tenant=new-again-houses"
   ```
2. Track each tool's count increment as Corey runs through.
3. After the ritual, update PROGRESS.md "Active blockers" to remove #2,
   and AUDIT_PLAN.md "Audits completed" with the verification timestamps.

**Pre-flight (must do before ritual):**
1. `railway whoami` → confirm auth.
2. `git log --oneline -3` → confirm last commit is Session 65 close.
3. `railway deployment list --service Gunner-Claude | head -3` →
   confirm last deploy is SUCCESS (after Session 65, this should always
   be the case unless a new failure surfaces).
4. Smoke-test the diagnostic endpoint returns HTTP 200 with the right
   shape before starting (use the curl above).
5. Read `docs/AUDIT_PLAN.md` "Blocker #2 verification ritual" — this
   is the canonical click-path doc.

**Why this is the right next thing:**
- All code-side work for Blocker #2 is shipped (verified Session 65).
  The only thing standing between us and closing the blocker is running
  the ritual.
- Closing Blocker #2 unblocks D-045 (KPI snapshot timing) + P4 (`/tasks/`
  deletion) which both have assistant-action implications.
- The diagnostic endpoint also serves as ongoing health check — once
  the blocker is closed, periodic curls verify no regression.

**Carry-forward backlog (don't lose track):**
- 216 in-flight unlinked calls (Q4 gap from v1.1 Wave 4) — nightly retroactive
  sweep cron is the v1.2 candidate.
- Day Hub task auto-generation from Buy Signal (surface landed Session 61,
  cron not wired).
- Sweep candidates from `scripts/REGISTRY.md` re-evaluate ≥ 2026-06-01:
  reset-processing.ts, flip-failed-to-pending.ts, check-progress.ts.

**Bigger backlog (post-Blocker #2):**
- P4 — legacy `/tasks/` deletion (5-step plan in AUDIT_PLAN.md).
- P5 — `assign_contact_to_user` UI flow alignment.
- P6 — View As cookie + server-side resolution (Shape C).
- D-045 — KPI snapshot timestamp (createdAt vs calledAt) decision.
- D-046 — Test framework (vitest)?
- Bug #25 — one-line cleanup from Session 56.
- 60 silent catches still in baseline (down from 71). Next 10 worth fixing
  if a future session touches the relevant files for other reasons.

## Earlier — Pre-Scaling Cleanup Wave COMPLETE (2026-05-01, Session 64)

5 phases / 6 commits / 1 session. Audit baseline → cleanup deltas:

| Audit finding | Pre | Post | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Duplicate-export type-mismatch (`formatCurrency`) | 1 | 0 | ✅ Phase 1 |
| Direct `process.env.*` outside `config/env.ts` (Anthropic) | 15 | 0 | ✅ Phase 2 |
| Direct `process.env.*` outside `config/env.ts` (Resend) | 2 | 0 | ✅ Phase 2 |
| Silent catches | 71 | 60 | ✅ Phase 3 (target ≤62) |
| Runtime field-source patch in `/api/health` | 1 | 0 | ✅ Phase 4 |
| Untracked-purpose scripts in `/scripts/` | 57 | 0 | ✅ Phase 5 (REGISTRY) |

Commits (in shipping order):
- `c1bcc5f` Phase 1 — drop duplicate formatCurrency
- `8c78047` Phase 2 — centralize Anthropic + Resend env reads
- `3077fe4` Phase 3 — wire logFailure into 11 high-impact silent catches
- `1f5d42b` Phase 4 — extract health-check field-source patch to script
- `fa37afb` Phase 5 — scripts/REGISTRY.md per-script catalog

Live verification: `GET /api/health` post-Phase-4-deploy returned HTTP 200,
`{"status":"ok"}`. No regressions reported on Anthropic-using endpoints
(Phase 2 was a refactor of construction site only — no behavior change).

## Earlier — Pre-Scaling Cleanup Wave plan (Session 63 audit, shipped Session 64)

v1.1 Seller/Buyer redesign **CLOSED** Session 63. Before kicking off
the next large feature-build sprint, a backend audit (Session 63 end-
of-session) surfaced a small cleanup wave worth doing first to reduce
foot-guns and architectural debt while features land fast.

**Audit results (verified, not assumed):**
- ✅ 0 orphan API routes (111 total, all referenced)
- ✅ 0 hardcoded production identifiers in code
- ✅ 0 actual TODO/FIXME comments
- ✅ 0 actual `any` types or `@ts-ignore`
- ✅ 91/91 tenant routes on `withTenant`
- 🟡 1 duplicate-export type-mismatch (`formatCurrency`)
- 🟡 75 direct `process.env.*` reads outside `config/env.ts`
- 🟡 72 silent catches (down from 79; top-10 worth fixing)
- 🟡 Runtime field-source patch in `/api/health` (one-shot migration owed)
- 🟢 3 untracked-purpose scripts in `/scripts/`

**Cleanup wave — 5 phases, do in order:**

### Phase 1 — `formatCurrency` consolidation (30 min)

**Why first**: highest blast radius. Two functions with the same name
return different types (`string | null` vs `string`). Callers importing
the wrong one have silent type-mismatch.

Steps:
1. Pick `lib/format.ts` version as canonical (returns `string | null`,
   safer for null-coalescing).
2. Delete `formatCurrency` from `lib/utils.ts:13`.
3. Grep callers: `grep -rn "from '@/lib/utils'" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -i "formatCurrency"`.
4. Update any `formatCurrency` callers that imported from `lib/utils`
   to import from `lib/format`.
5. Fix any caller that depended on the string-not-null behavior
   (TypeScript will surface these — coalesce with `?? '—'` or `?? 'N/A'`).
6. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Phase 2 — Centralize Anthropic + Resend clients (1.5h)

**Why**: 8 routes do `new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY! })`
inline. CLAUDE.md says env vars go through `config/env.ts`. Pattern
already exists for other clients.

Steps:
1. Create `config/anthropic.ts` exporting a singleton:
   ```ts
   // config/anthropic.ts
   import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk'
   import { env } from './env'
   export const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY })
   ```
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to the env schema in `config/env.ts` if not
   already there.
3. Find all 8 instantiation sites:
   `grep -rn "new Anthropic" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"`.
   Probable locations: `lib/ai/grading.ts`, `lib/ai/extract-deal-intel.ts`,
   `lib/ai/coach.ts`, `lib/ai/scoring.ts`, `lib/ai/generate-user-profiles.ts`,
   `lib/ai/generate-property-story.ts`, `lib/ai/enrich-property.ts`,
   `app/api/properties/[propertyId]/buyers/route.ts`.
4. Replace each `const anthropic = new Anthropic(...)` with `import { anthropic } from '@/config/anthropic'`.
5. Same shape for Resend in `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts:10` →
   `config/email.ts`.
6. `npx tsc --noEmit` + verify by hitting one Anthropic-using endpoint
   (call detail) on the live deploy after push.

**Out of scope**: the other 60+ direct `process.env.*` reads. Most are
NEXTAUTH_SECRET (NextAuth-required), NEXT_RUNTIME (instrumentation
runtime check), NODE_ENV (dev guards). Leave those — they're at the
runtime/framework boundary where direct reads are correct.

### Phase 3 — Top-10 silent catches (2h)

**Why**: 72 silent catches = 72 debugging blind spots when something
fails in production. Not all need fixing — fire-and-forget for non-
critical writes is fine. The top-10 are in the high-impact paths.

Steps:
1. Run `bash scripts/check-silent-catches.sh > /tmp/silent-catches.txt`.
2. Triage the output by file. Priority paths:
   - `lib/ai/grading.ts` — grading flow errors
   - `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts` — vendor data sync errors
   - `lib/v1_1/seller_rollup.ts` — rollup write errors
   - `lib/v1_1/call_seller_autolink.ts` — autolink errors
   - `app/api/webhooks/ghl/route.ts` — webhook processing errors
   - `app/api/webhooks/ghl/register/route.ts` — webhook registration
   - `lib/grading-processor.ts` — worker iteration errors
   - `lib/ai/extract-deal-intel.ts` — extraction errors
3. For each, replace `.catch(err => console.log(...))` with the
   `logFailure()` helper from `lib/audit.ts`. Pattern documented in
   `scripts/check-silent-catches.sh` output and AGENTS.md.
4. Verify count drops to ≤62 via re-running the script.
5. PROGRESS notes updated baseline.

**Skip**: the ~50 remaining silent catches that are intentional fire-
and-forget (audit log writes, telemetry pings — failure of these
shouldn't block the request). Document the convention.

### Phase 4 — Health-check field-source migration (1h)

**Why**: `/api/health` runs a one-time `"ai" → "api"` field-source
rename on every request until all Property rows are clean. Brittle
and runs forever.

Steps:
1. Read `app/api/health/route.ts:52-71` to confirm current logic.
2. Create `scripts/migrate-field-source-ai-to-api.ts` — a one-shot
   that does the same rename, idempotent.
3. Run once via `npx tsx scripts/migrate-field-source-ai-to-api.ts`
   against production (read-only first, then apply).
4. Remove the runtime patch from `/api/health/route.ts` — health check
   becomes stateless again.
5. Verify `/api/health` still returns `{ status: "ok" }` after deploy.

### Phase 5 — Scripts registry (30 min)

**Why**: 57 files in `/scripts/`. New devs (and future Claude) can't
tell which are one-shot vs recurring vs deletable.

Steps:
1. Create `scripts/REGISTRY.md` with columns:
   `Script | Purpose | Idempotent? | Last Run | Safe to delete after`.
2. Cross-reference with `docs/OPERATIONS.md` "Operational scripts"
   section (already partially categorizes them).
3. Mark `scripts/reset-processing.ts`, `scripts/flip-failed-to-pending.ts`,
   `scripts/check-progress.ts` as deletable-after-date if not used
   in 30 days.

**Discipline gates carry-forward from v1.1**:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean before every push (pre-push hook enforces).
- Class-4 helper rule: any new `lib` helper that takes a record id
  takes `tenantId` explicitly. Reference: AGENTS.md end-of-Wave-3.
- Hybrid commit pattern for any backfill / data migration: commit code +
  diagnostic, run dry-run, review, then apply.

**Hot threads from v1.1 (don't lose track)**:
- Verification routine fires 2026-05-02 ~17:00 UTC and reports back
  on whether runtime auto-link / Seller rollup is firing on freshly
  graded calls. Check `https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_01TFP5vnSKsM2RWJiCBxRxN4`
  next session start.
- 216 in-flight unlinked calls (Q4 gap — new leads where Seller
  hadn't been backfilled when call landed). Candidate for a nightly
  retroactive sweep cron in a follow-up wave.
- Day Hub task auto-generation from Buy Signal (surface landed
  Session 61, cron not wired).

**Bigger backlog (post-cleanup wave)**:
- Blocker #2 — Role Assistant production verification of the 6 high-
  stakes action types. Real risk; been open since v1-finish.
- P4 — legacy `/tasks/` deletion (5-step plan in AUDIT_PLAN.md).
- P5 — `assign_contact_to_user` UI flow alignment.
- P6 — View As cookie + server-side resolution (Shape C).
- D-045 — KPI snapshot timestamp (createdAt vs calledAt) decision.
- D-046 — Test framework (vitest)?
- Bug #25 — one-line cleanup from Session 56.

## Earlier — v1.1 sprint COMPLETE (2026-05-01)

v1.1 Seller/Buyer redesign **CLOSED** with Session 63 (commit `fd569e3`).
All 6 waves shipped + applied + verified. Reliability scorecard dim #8
moved 4 → 8/10 (target met).

**v1.1 wave summary:**

| Wave | Scope | Session | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Additive schema (Seller +17, Buyer +5, PropertyBuyerStage +1) | 60 | ✅ |
| 2 | Backfill Property.owner_* → Seller (16 sellers, 221 fields) | 60 | ✅ APPLIED |
| 3a | /sellers/ list page + nav | 60 | ✅ |
| 3b | Sellers tab on inventory + manualBuyerIds migration | 60 | ✅ |
| 4 | AI extraction → typed Seller columns + Q5 mirror-write + post-grade rollup + Q4 auto-link + Q6 Buy Signal + Q7 matchScore | 61 | ✅ APPLIED |
| 5 | Property column strip cutover (24 cols + 2 idx dropped) | 62 | ✅ APPLIED |

**v1.1 sprint pick-from-here (none are blockers; pick based on bandwidth):**

1. **Carry-forward small wins:**
   - Q6 Day Hub task auto-generation from Buy Signal (surface landed Session 61; cron not wired)
   - Retroactive auto-link sweep cron (216 calls in flight where Seller hadn't been backfilled when call landed)
   - Verification routine result review (scheduled remote agent fires 2026-05-02 ~17:00 UTC; check audit-log evidence)

2. **From AUDIT_PLAN carry-forward (independent of v1.1):**
   - **P4** — legacy `/tasks/` deletion migration (5-step plan in AUDIT_PLAN.md)
   - **P5** — `assign_contact_to_user` UI flow alignment
   - **P6** — View As cookie + server-side resolution (Shape C)
   - **D-045** — KPI snapshot timestamp (createdAt vs calledAt) decision
   - **D-046** — Add test framework (vitest)?
   - **Blocker #2** — production verification of the 6 high-stakes Role Assistant action types

3. **Hygiene:**
   - 73 silent catches in audit (down from 79; queued sweep)
   - Bug #25 from Session 56 (one-line cleanup, never closed)

Recommendation: start with the verification routine result (it'll be in
by next session) + Blocker #2 (the only OPEN blocker). Then pick from
P4-P6 / D-045-046 based on what surfaces in the next 1-2 sessions.

**Operational lesson from v1.1 sprint:** Railway edge proxy first-byte
timeout is ~6 min. Long-running diagnostic applies should split into
phases or stream progress. The Node process keeps writing past the HTTP
timeout, so a "client got timeout error" doesn't mean writes were lost
— always re-check via dry-run before retrying. (Documented in
docs/OPERATIONS.md diagnostic endpoints table.)

## Next Session — DEFERRED — Wave 3 Phase B [SHIPPED Session 60]

Wave 1 + Wave 2 + Wave 3 Phase A all shipped 2026-04-30 (Session 60).
Phase B is the larger half of Wave 3 — best done with fresh context.

Plan reference:
[docs/v1.1/SELLER_BUYER_PLAN.md §8 Wave 3](docs/v1.1/SELLER_BUYER_PLAN.md).

**Wave 3 Phase B scope:**

1. **Property Research tab Sellers + Buyers sub-tabs** at
   `app/(tenant)/[tenant]/inventory/[propertyId]/`. Render linked
   sellers (via PropertySeller) and buyers (via PropertyBuyerStage)
   inline so the inventory detail page exposes the new entity model
   without forcing a click out to /sellers/[id].

2. **Read-path migration of ~30 sites that read `property.owner*`
   columns directly** → switch to read from linked Seller (via
   `property.sellers[0].seller` or a fresh helper). Enumerate:

   ```bash
   grep -rn "ownerPhone\|owner_phone\|ownerEmail\|owner_email\|ownerType\|owner_type\|secondOwner\|second_owner\|ownerFirstName\|owner_first_name\|ownerLastName\|owner_last_name\|ownershipLengthYears\|ownerPortfolio\|seniorOwner\|deceasedOwner\|cashBuyerOwner\|manualBuyerIds\|manual_buyer_ids" \
     "lib/" "app/" "components/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" \
     | grep -v "lib/v1_1\|lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts"
   ```

   Excluded files: `lib/v1_1/wave_2_backfill.ts` (intentional reads
   for the backfill itself) and `lib/enrichment/sync-seller.ts` (the
   dual-write site — must keep reading both).

   Heaviest read site: `components/inventory/property-detail-client.tsx`
   (~30 read points around lines 168-3735, including portfolio widgets).

3. **Optional: P6 (View-As cookie + server-side resolution)** before
   adding new client components that read View-As state. The Wave 6.2
   hydration race lesson — synchronous useState initializers — applies
   to anything new in Phase B. P6 closes the leak class structurally
   (httpOnly cookie + server resolveEffectiveUser). See AUDIT_PLAN.md P6
   for security review checklist (CSRF, setter blast radius, cross-tab
   semantics).

**Acceptance:**
- Pre-flight grep returns zero hits for `property.owner*` reads outside
  the two excluded files.
- Inventory detail page renders Sellers + Buyers sub-tabs and the existing
  legacy-rendering inline owner cards continue to work (dual-read window).
- No console errors / hydration warnings on /sellers/, /sellers/[id],
  /buyers/, /buyers/[id], /inventory/[id].

**After Phase B lands:**
- Wave 4 (AI enrichment routing — see PLAN §5)
- Wave 5 (Property column drops + cutover — destructive, requires
  Railway snapshot)
- Wave 6 (verification + handoff)

**Carry-forward decisions still queued (Q4-Q7 from PLAN §11):**
- Q4 — Auto-link calls by ghlContactId (sprint-time).
- Q5 — Mirror legal-distress flags between Property and Seller
  (sprint-time, design call before Wave 4).
- Q6 — Seller Buy Signal (Wave 4 AI integration).
- Q7 — Move Buyer matchScore from Buyer → PropertyBuyerStage (Wave 4).

**Carry-forward decisions still queued for Corey** (not blockers for Wave 2):
- **D-045** — KPI snapshot timestamp (createdAt vs calledAt)?
- **D-046** — Add test framework (vitest)?
- **P4** — When to start `/tasks/` deletion migration? (5-step plan in AUDIT_PLAN.md)
- **P5** — `assign_contact_to_user` UI flow alignment.
- **P6** — View As cookie + server-side resolution (Shape C).
  Recommendation per plan: land BEFORE v1.1 Wave 3 (new client components reading tenant-scoped data hit the same hydration race class as Wave 6.2).

**Carry-forward bug debt** (low-priority, deferred from v1):
- Bug #16 — DEV_BYPASS_AUTH hardcoded slugs (clean before tenant #2)
- Bug #17 — no_answer never rewritten to short_call (cron processor)
- Bug #18 — 2487 calls with `source IS NULL` (one-time backfill)
- Bug #20 — deal-intel parser doesn't strip markdown fences
- Bug #21 — sentiment/sellerMotivation type coercion incomplete
- Bug #22 — 24 empty-shell FAILED rows from 2026-04-20 (one-time cleanup)
- Bug #23 — heartbeat audit rows on other crons (poll-calls, daily-audit,
  etc.)
- Bug #24 — body-size gap on `/api/ai/assistant/execute`
- Bug #25 — `/api/calls-review-count` 404 (one-line cleanup in
  `components/ui/top-nav.tsx:42`)

These don't block v1.1 kickoff but are eventually-resolve items.

**Production state at sprint close (2026-04-30):**
- All 9 v1-launch-ready exit criteria met (see Session 59).
- Reliability scorecard: all 8 dimensions ≥7/10 except item 8
  (Seller/Buyer data model = 4/10, the v1.1 redesign target).
- webhook_logs last 24h: 1558 received, 1 failed (0.06%), 0 stuck.
- daily-health-check: 3 audit_logs ERROR (low, within tolerance).
- silent-catches sweep: 73 violations (down from 79 baseline; queued
  in AUDIT_PLAN as ongoing hygiene).
