## Next Session — Start Exactly Here

**Task:** Test live deployment + activate for daily use

1. Test on Railway: click through every page, verify data loads
2. Make a test call in GHL → verify it gets graded with playbook context
3. Test Role Assistant: ask it questions, have it send SMS, create tasks
4. When ready for monetization: activate Stripe (see .env.example for vars needed)
5. Consider: Next.js 14 → 15 upgrade to fix remaining npm audit vulnerabilities
